149093g,Presentation differences,"Me and my husband have ADHD, he has inattentive presentation and mine is more hyperactive.
During many discussions I explain it in my head this way: he is able to find sources of dopamine internally,  by thinking about things like spaceships, or world building.
Where as I usually am not able to amuse myself in this way and so seek dopamine from external sources.
To me this explains our very different symptoms for the same route cause, but I'm wondering if this holds up outside our 2 examples.

How do you see the differences in presentation?",1
14903kr,Can't sleep racing thoughts,"This is probably very common with many of us here. 

I need some tips or advice about what you do when you can't sleep because your thoughts are racing. My thoughts seems to constantly shift from one thing to the next when closing my eyes it's as if my thoughts increase 

What do you guys do in this situation?

Sometimes I listen to podcasts which seem to take some of the focus off my thoughts.  

Thank you",1
1490208,Forgotten wife,"My husband has diagnosed ADHD. For every anniversary, mother's day and birthday, it's underwhelming. He either forgets it's a special day or picks an activity/ dinner place at the last minute. It makes me feel forgotten and underappreciated. I've talked to him about this issue multiple times. He says he understands the issue, states that the ADHD and anxiety are the problems related to the forgetfulness or last minute plans.

He says that he will work on it next time, but nothing ever changes. We used to celebrate my birthday, Vday and our anniversary but for the last 3 years, it has gone downhill. He's a great partner and father overall. What type of tools, tips or reminders help with someone who has ADHD and anxiety?",1
148ztb0,Need help regarding stimulants .,Hi i am 27m with adhd. I was prescribed with strattera which was wonderful for me but due to low sleep and high heart rate it was bad for me. I am on ritalin now but it's not as good as strattera and SR is worst. Can you guys share which stimulants worked better for you if you gone through the same thing. Like switched from strattera which was working for you but need to change.,1
148zqlr,30M medication and sex drive questions,"Healthy active male Diagnosed at 30 after an injury that has stopped me from being as active with fitness as i used to be.

Have always managed adhd with a healthy lifestyle, and have always had a very high libido/sed drive, never any issues getting erections, can easily finish quick or last a long time if i need to.
Intimacy, sex and the whole act of flirting and building lust has definitely been the biggest dopamine hit for me throughout my adult life, and it‚Äôs something I enjoy about myself, its manageable and by 30 years old it‚Äôs a part of who i am.

Some aspects of my life i have lost motivation for and sought out intervention with psycs and now a low dose of 30mg Vyvanse 12 hour release.

Only 2 days in so i know i will get plenty of reasonable people saying to just give it a go.
But i really value my sex life and sex drive in general, I‚Äôm not prepared to risk changing that for some other benefits, its just not an acceptable trade off in my opinion.

Only 2 days and I feel more active, willing to do odd tasks i would put off, and they don‚Äôt feel like a burden.
Not having the overly stimulated mind on sex, which for some might like that effect but for me I want it to stay.
Can make myself get hard, but not as strong as before, have to focus to keep it going.

Have been and plan to keep having meds in the morning, before a protein rich breakfast, drink plenty of water, healthy diet and some magnesium, zinc, l-arganine and l-glutamate supplements.
Still doing moderate exercise.

Just interested in others similar experiences, long tern outcomes, advice, anything is helpful for me at this stage.

The ability to hyper-fixate when needed, the bursts of energy and the hyper sexuality are positive traits for me.
So I am thinking of stopping meds and just try doing more fitness, and generally sorting my life out so i can manage my adhd in a good way as i have for so many years.

Also have become recently single after many years, and have found that I‚Äôve gotten a lot of motivation from being single and having to be the best version of myself physically and mentally to be attractive to women, so that may be another way for me to get my life sorted.

Again any info helpful, please be kind, no horrible comments needed.
Thanks",1
148ziog,Am I faking my adhd :/,So I‚Äôve been diagnosed and I‚Äôve had all the inattentive symptoms all my life but since I‚Äôm not hyperactive and also a girl :/ I‚Äôve just been told I‚Äôm lazy all my life and I‚Äôm not trying hard enough and that I have so much more potential whatever that means.. so when I got diagnosed at 26 it was a relief. But I made the mistake of mentioning my adhd to my colleague just now (we were talking about coffee and I said it makes me sleepy) and he just went on and on about how adhd symptoms are normal and everyone has them and I‚Äôm exaggerating and just being completely dismissive even though he doesn‚Äôt know me that well.. I developed really severe anxiety to cope with my adhd and now I‚Äôm trying to find the right meds and it‚Äôs really hard! It‚Äôs really difficult and frustrating when your struggles are not visible and frankly sound so silly like adhd paralysis. So when he wouldn‚Äôt stop about me not having it cause ‚Äúyou‚Äôre smart‚Äù it just really made me feel like shit. Maybe I don‚Äôt have it idk but I definitely have something and I‚Äôm just really tired of trying so hard to fix it. Maybe I‚Äôll just never get treated and these are the cards I‚Äôve been dealt :/,1

148z5op,Tip for those struggling to stay off from your phone,"I bet most of you tried setting screen time limits on your phone, but it doesn‚Äôt work because you just bypass it.

So here‚Äôs what you need to do:

On iOS, tap the ‚ÄúUse Screen Time Passcode‚Äù. Then, ask someone close to you to type a password, but to keep it from you. I‚Äôm sure you can do something similar on Android as well.

Now whenever you try to bypass the limit, you need to ask this person to type the password for you :)

Edit: Unless you really need to, don‚Äôt be super hard on yourself. If your daily screen time average is say, 10 hours, don‚Äôt set a limit of 2 hour a day right away. Try 8 or 6 hours and work your way down.",1
148z2z7,"Need Someone to Connect with, I Guess?","Hey Everyone.  


I was diagnosed with ADHD Combined Subtype this year and it's been hell of an experience.  


A little about myself, I live in India and I graduated Medical School in 2021. Things have always been difficult for me. Academics have ALWAYS been brutal for me, like forever. The only reason I've gotten to where I am is because of my sheer willpower and brute force. The hurdles I've had to cross have weighed me down, emotionally and physically as well.

Not to mention this lifetime's worth of trauma that I've experienced has started catching up to me. Somehow, I distinctly remember all the negative and evils things that I've been through and all the extremely harsh words of some of the people I've had the displeasure of keeping in my life.  People saw me as dumb, lazy and unmotivated individual and I too shared that thought since I never knew what wrong with me. And with that thought, I've pushed forward, never quitting and telling myself that I've to work harder than others since I'm dumb and stupid. And I think that exhaustion has finally caught up to me.

I remember in high school, this really mean teacher told me that I've zero potential to pursue medicine and life sciences and should resort to something else. I try to focus on all the positives and the good things I've done, all the people I've helped as a doctor. But it gets overwhelming at times.

It was a relief when I got my diagnosis, I got the answer to the question I used to ask myself very frequently ""Why am I like this? What's wrong with me?"". I also got diagnosed with dysthymia in my last visit to me doctor. We got into a conversation about joy and happiness, and came to the realization that it's been forever since I felt a sliver of joy.

I'm tired of all the failures and the continuous need to constantly push myself even with the things I want. I guess I'm just exhausted. It's an uphill battle, and I know I'll make it eventually. 

But, does it ever get easier?

Sorry for the long post.

Thanks :)",2
148yv27,My Adhd coping strategies bother other people,"Does anyone else run into ridicule or intense questioning from neuronorms about their adhd coping strategies?
I have a small 24 hr planner that I carry daily. Writing out my schedule on a physical calendar just works better than solely putting stuff in my phone calendar. When I look at my iPhone calendar and see multiple dots in one week I get overwhelmed. 
My friend saw me writing in my planner and had so many questions, ‚Äújust use your phone‚Äù Isn‚Äôt it inconvenient to carry? What if you lose it?‚Äù I got so frustrated by the questions. I hate having to explain why something that works for them doesn‚Äôt work for me because they always have a million reasons why their way should work.

This has happened with other things as well. My boss was giving me a short list of things to do and got mad I was writing them down. She said I didn‚Äôt need to and to just pay attention. My brain just doesn‚Äôt work like that! I‚Äôm honestly amazed when I see other people watch a 10 step demonstration and then go complete all 10 steps. I have to watch step 1 then do step 1 and so forth unless I took notes.

My last example is that I used to keep a daily hygiene list on my mirror in my bathroom. It had things like 1. Brush teeth 2. Shower 3. Lotion and deodorant, etc. I keep the list because I often feel so lost and aimless in the mornings or overwhelmed I forget or it takes me 4hrs to get ready. 
The list is great until those occasions where someone else uses my bathroom and 10x out of 10 they comment on it. ‚ÄúWhy do you have that?‚Äù ‚ÄúWho needs a reminder to put on deodorant‚Äù ‚Äúhahaha do you really need to remind yourself to shower‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt just be different and do what works for me without other people challenging me on it. Do you guys run into this too and if so how do you handle it?",3
148yskq,Im super insecure about my job performance and worry that everyone wants me gone,"  
Basically my position doesn't get great training and we were told to just kinda figure it out as you go along. I've been here for months and Im extremely insecure about where im at. I get anxious really easy and im scared of doing the wrong thing so A LOT of the time I have to ask someone to help me with something, even when its something I could've figured out myself with some tinkering. 

  
My brain shuts off and all critical thinking goes out the window during these moments of ""oh fuck no ones ever showed me this specific task."" Its really simple stuff most of the time but because I don't have it down I always panic and ask for help and I feel like its pissing everyone off. 

  
At the same time people are nice to me and I am getting above average work hours than the rest so I think thats a good sign? I just cant stop being insecure and doubting everything. 

  
I hate that im this way because even in highschool I always had this nagging thought of like what if im in a special needs class and no ones told me kinda thing. I literally never had any special needs classes but I always had this what if doubt in my mind all the time. 

  
I hate how im always doubting myself. 

  
Are there any like red or green flags to look out for in a situation like this? Like I said my hours are good and people respond to me pretty normally but they could be faking...? I assume if I was a shit employee my hours would be cut but its the opposite of that. Sure im not making the highest hours but im one of the higher ones for sure. And at the end of the day thats really all I could ask for right?? If im getting good hours it means I bring value to the company? 

  
Its so silly because there really is nothing blaring that im bad. Im just insecure and anxious but I do try and ask questions when im unsure. I am learning slowly but I still feel like what if everyone just talks shit behind my back and cant wait for me to clock out...

  
I keep thinking if I just message my boss in a casual way mentioning something about getting a job performance review, maybe some things I should work on but idk. It feels desperate and kinda weird. sad almost. I also asked a friend and he said if the worker was shit he'd just give them a pity answer.  
Im just so sad that im always doing this to myself. I KNOW if I was just confident in myself my performance would be great. my memory woudl be better, my critical thinking would be better, my social interactions would be better. But I just cower in fear at everyting and anyone. 

  
That reminds me. My social skills are fucked. Im too shy and too scared of judgment to be myself so Im just that lame guy that barely talks unless someone forces answers out of me. 

  
I really want to talk to people and be included in the social zone but I keep myself from it.",1
148ysbh,Stopping Vyvanse,"I been on this medication 20mg, for week and i only dislike that i cant sleep and makes me jittery in mornings. 
I am able to focus at work, calmed my anxiety, energy to work through the day, socialize better, been in a good mood and been able to focus in studying. Mostly due to the dopamine from this medication. Before i got on this med i would get anxious especially because i work from home, low energy due to having PCOS, loose concentration when studying and moody. 
But worry i will become dependent on this medication.

148ypga,How do I stop being such an angry jerk when I‚Äôm woken up and am feeling overly tired?,"I‚Äôm usually an incredibly nice person. In fact, most people tell me I‚Äôm TOO nice.

But none of them have seen me absolutely exhausted, like when I‚Äôm woken up early and didn‚Äôt get enough sleep. I suddenly turn into a short-fused monster. It makes me despise myself.

I‚Äôm desperate for suggestions. Just please don‚Äôt say that I should ask people to give me space in the morning, or that I should take my meds 15 min before I wake up. Those are great ideas but I really need to find a way to control my stupid emotions at ALL times. Without medication or people getting out of my way‚Ä¶even if I‚Äôm woken up at 1 AM.

And I realize our prefrontal cortex shuts down when we are tired, so we don‚Äôt have full control over our emotions, but again, that excuse isn‚Äôt good enough for me. I want to stop being mean when my brain is shut down & in reptilian mode. My loved ones don‚Äôt deserve to be snapped at for simply existing.

Again, I‚Äôm never EVER like that when I‚Äôm wide awake! It ONLY happens the first 5 minutes after being woken up if I‚Äôm overly exhausted. I genuinely don‚Äôt feel like I have control over myself when I‚Äôm that tired. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm on autopilot for the first 5 minutes after I‚Äôm woke up and my brain is literally offline. Someone please tell me you have a helpful suggestion for me. I would greatly appreciate anyone‚Äôs ideas at this point.",1
148yl6c,Being chronically late to work,"Had an incident at work tonight and I‚Äôm afraid to address this with my boss.

I (F27) have ADHD and 8 years ago was on adderall, became very addicted and ultimately stopped taking it/ became against pills because i didn‚Äôt realize *i* was the problem. A couple of years ago, i (am also bipolar) realized with proper management, it can be helpful and increase my quality of life. So i went on medication for bipolar. 

I started a new job in Sept 2022, and met a co-worker who is also a F with ADHD and very knowledgeable and medication positive. She is an advocate and we have had long conversations and inspired me to talk to my doctor about treating my ADHD with something more suitable for me- i work full time and am in school part time.

So anyway I started Astaryz a few months ago and it‚Äôs been much better than Adderall and less severe of a feeling. 

My co-worker doesn‚Äôt have the symptom of being chronically late, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs due to my ADHD because I absolutely cannot manage time at all, and I get so tripped up doing things at home before my shift that suddenly it‚Äôs my start time & I haven‚Äôt even left yet. 

I have spoken to co-workers about this and am usually 15-20 mins late, and start working hard as soon as i get in. 

One makes passive-aggressive jokes, whatever. Tonight, she made one, and another coworker snapped on me and yelled at me about it in a room full of people. 

I normally wouldn‚Äôt do this because i‚Äôm super anxious but i went up to her after and said what you did was rude and it makes me uncomfortable to work around you when you treat me that way, and she raised her voice at me and told me then you can leave. The whole room went silent.

I walked away and i emailed my boss but he wont see it until the morning and i plan on speaking to him about it in person too, but this means i have to have the conversation about being late which is awkward- i mentioned i can get a note from my doctor if necessary as we are currently working on medication management and it truly is affecting me and i do apologize‚Ä¶ 

I have tried so many things to be on time and it feels literally impossible. On top of it, i have spoken with my coworkers so they know im not trying to just be negligent, careless and inconsiderate.  

The coworker unexpectedly apologized, and we are going to have a more in depth conversation later where i plan on trying to explain my position further, but i still need to talk to my boss. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated, it took a lot for me to stand up for myself because i am nonconfrontational at work. 


TLDR; chronically late to work, trying to medication manage to get over this issue but have explained this to coworkers, coworker unexpectedly yelled at me in front of everyone for being late , i emailed my boss and now i dont know what to do",2

Beginning the task is difficult and staying consistent with it is even harder. So I‚Äôve found a trick that helps me, and is the ONLY thing I still use after years. Timers, etc didn‚Äôt help. 

I count. I decide to clean exactly 20 things. I count out loud as I do each one, and I have two rules. 1.) the next item I pick up has to be right next to the last item I picked. This seems to reduce paralysis because I‚Äôm not unconsciously deciding to clean easier things versus harder things or having to decide what area to clean next. 2.) if I go past 20, I have to start over and clean another 20 things. Usually by the 20th thing I‚Äôm in a bit of a flow and will go over it. But my rule is if I go over I have to start over again.

What anyone else can do easily, it takes me 3x as long. How the hell do people just DO THINGS?

I‚Äôve been diagnosed about 7 months and on meds. How can I be on the highest dose of meds and not feel a single thing. Why the hell won‚Äôt my brain just WORK????

I‚Äôm tired of being miserable. I‚Äôm tired of never doing what brings me joy. Having to study is like a cartoon piano constantly dangling over my head. I can never enjoy an activity without feeling guilty.",2
148wao8,My son is struggling socially,"My son (8M) was diagnosed with ADHD 4 years back and has been on medication and is doing ok in school but it‚Äôs the social aspects where he is struggling. 

He is unable to concentrate on games and kids don‚Äôt want to play baseball or soccer with him. He compensates by inventing ‚Äòpretend play‚Äô games but other boys feel it‚Äôs too childish to play those games anymore. I try to engage him in games such as tennis and biking but he really wants to play team sports but it breaks his heart when they bench him constantly. He says his friends call him dumb as he is unable to focus on what they are saying and kids aren‚Äôt playing with him. This is causing him to have issues managing his anger / emotions in school which is further increasing the isolation. 

I am neuro typical and I was pretty popular in school and I don‚Äôt know how to help my son.

148w2dh,Considering legal action against psychiatrist (new ‚Äústimulant use contract‚Äù from a practice that has committed several crimes and being investigated by the state),"I‚Äôve been going to my psychiatry practice for 5+ years. I was diagnosed with severe ADHD as a kid, and have been on and off meds for it my entire life. Despite that, I have a great career and have been successful in my adult life. 

I‚Äôve been back on Adderall for several years, and it has saved my life and career. When I was off of it, I had a tendency to drink more, couldn‚Äôt ever focus, and had severe anxiety and depression. My current psychiatric practice isn‚Äôt great‚Ä¶ to say the least. They‚Äôve been in serious legal trouble over the last several years for falsifying documents, overprescribing, and straight up fraud. I‚Äôve been bounced from doctor to doctor as my previous ones were either fired or quit (there are next to no options for mental health care where I live). I‚Äôve never been once asked take a urine test until today. This was sprung on me, and I was told I would need to go to a lab to have it conducted within 2 weeks. When I asked why, my psychiatrist simply said ‚Äúit‚Äôs what we do.‚Äù Then she gave me a contract I‚Äôm supposed to sign stating random urine and blood tests upon request. Nothing in this contract explains exactly what will be tested in my urine and blood and what health data will be collected. There is not one SINGLE mention of patient privacy or patient rights. I take my meds as prescribed and don‚Äôt take illicit substances, but there‚Äôs zero fucking change I turn over more of my healthcare data to this incredibly corrupt company, that has falsified patient info to get government funding (old leadership is being charged with multiple crimes and the local government has cut ties). I don‚Äôt believe for a second they aren‚Äôt doing this for any other reason than to bill additional charges and I suspect they are selling patient data to third parties for a profit. 

Is this document even legal? Does it violate patient privacy or transparency laws? I‚Äôm furious that I‚Äôm being treated as a criminal, by a healthcare practitioner run by actual criminals. Your former CEO and former practitioners broke several laws, and now you‚Äôre forcing patients to pay for it? I‚Äôm considering reporting this to the state of Colorado and reaching out to my local paper to warn others. I get that some practitioners do this, but healthcare data privacy is a REAL issue and NO ONE should trust their data in the hands of an entity this shady. 

I called back after reading the contract and I was passed to three different people. First one said ‚ÄúI had no idea we were doing this.‚Äù The second one said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt collect blood ever‚Äù (then don‚Äôt put it in your contract) and third said ‚Äúit‚Äôs up to your practitioner.‚Äù (Discrimination?)

148vxoj,Are Prasco and other ‚Äúauthorized generics‚Äù actually identical like they claim?,"Hey all. 

Insurance isn‚Äôt covering name brand Adderall without prior authorization from my doctor. Last month was my first month on it and I didn‚Äôt have insurance so I coughed up the $250 for name brand just to try it. It worked very well and I liked it a lot. 

I got insurance between then and now, and I specifically got insurance with a brand rx copay that I was comfortable with so I can get name brand. Of fucking course I try and get it today and they deny coverage saying that I can‚Äôt get brand without prior authorization from my doc. I feel like I got conned. What the hell am I paying for insurance for??

Anyways, I just filled with generic (Prasco) because my doc said I‚Äôd have to try the generic before she can give an authorization for brand, and even then it‚Äôs a long shot. 

I went down a rabbit hole today about the generics vs brand, and according to Prascos website and other sources, they are identical in every way to name brand. Is this actually true? Like every single aspect of the drug is exactly identical?

My doctor explained that some generics differ in inactive ingredients and can vary in bioavailability and efficacy, which is why I wanted to stick with name brand. If Prasco is literally the exact same then why does anyone go with brand name? I‚Äôd imagine there has to be some difference somewhere?",2
148vxi0,I'm getting tired of losing friends,"It seems like every couple of years I lose a huge group of friends. This most recent one seems to be teetering on the edge. For this instance, it seems like we were all cool with the way we treated each other.


Poking fun at one another for a few things, but we all had a mutual understanding that none of it was meant to be hurtful in anyway. When buttons were pushed, we let off, apologized, and came to an agreement that the certain topic is to not be discussed.


That was until recently where it seems like everyone has now turned against me. I've said the same things I've been saying for the past 2-3 years with this group, and all of a sudden it's a problem. Or at least it seems so. The other option being that the way I've acted has always been a problem and each and every one of them has bitten their tongue until now.


If that's the case, then why not say anything in the beginning? We already have had instances where things were agreed not to be poked at. Why did they not say anything at those times? Why has it just now become a problem?


The thought of losing thesw friends has me teetering on the edge of sanity. Truly, I mean it. These are the people who brought me out of my covid lockdown depression. They rekindled my love for video games. I've met amazing people and have done things with these people that I never thought I would do. I don't know what I would do if I lose these people.",5

I should have known like there were more sections to the exam.

The worst part is i prepared very well just like other exams i usually ace it, i scored like 152/1000 whcih essentially mean i scored probably the entire marks for the only section i completed, i should have known there were other sections.

148viil,Filled my house with smoke this morning...,"...because I sat on the couch ten feet away from the stove. While I heated up the spaghetti I had already finished making a few minutes prior. Heavily invested in the sitcom playing on the TV(on an episode I've already seen).

It took me a good ten minutes to smell it- completely forgot it was there! Hours worth of damage control: I ended up opening several windows, including my bedroom. I left my front and my back door opened for up to an hour. I poured baking soda everywhere; cleaned surfaces with degreaser & pine sol at least two times over; sprayed febreeze on the curtains and mopped the floors; washed my (exposed) arms & changed my clothes; even sprayed the crispy burnt pan with a hose outside.

The smoke lingered for over half an hour and I could see it. All because my eyes were glued to the TV. I could have enjoyed my lunch. Don't be like me lol.

148uy41,My partner has ADHD and I love him & am doing what I can to be supportive but not being listened to is very hard for me to cope with personally. I'm looking for tips or different/better ways to broach this to him as it's particularly challenging.,"Hi guys!   


First, I want you all to know that I don't want my partner or any of you to feel bad about this specific topic, especially if it mirrors your lives, but I just need a bit of advice from those who would know best r.e. solving this problem. I'm more than happy to help him find things, taking care of paying bills/rent & general time management, helping with stress management etc. The one symptom that I cannot cope with emotionally and certainly won't be able to cope with long-term is not being listened to. I understand this happening to some extent, but I feel like I'm constantly getting talked over or not listened to, to the point where I can hardly ever finish a story/the point I'm making/even short sentences. I know that he doesn't mean it, but it makes me feel like I might as well not bother even trying to tell him a story that I won't be able to finish or making a point that might take a while to explain with necessary detail.   


This is particularly upsetting to me because my family ignored me/hardly listened to me most of the time as a child and when I'm trying to tell him something and he either changes the subject, interjects or simply does not seem to listen or compute what I've said, it makes me feel pathetic and unimportant like it used to when I was young. I've tried to explain this to him and he got defensive as though I was accusing him of doing this on purpose, and I know he isn't, but I need to be heard and if any of you could offer advice r.e. how to communicate this to him in a constructive manner, I would appreciate it a lot.",3

1487r49,"I struggle with ""One More Try"" disease, is this an ADHD thing?","I was recently diagnosed with ADHD in my late 20s and have started taking generic Concerta.

I've realized that one of my biggest problems is that when doing any number of activities I have an inability to stop trying something until I achieve some arbitrary goal I've set for myself. I'll tell myself ""one more try"" or ""ten more tries"" but that never stops me. I'll keep trying something over and over until either I accomplish it or I'm facing severe consequences or exhaustion.

There are many instances where this affects me. I snowboard and skateboard and sometimes I will be unable to stop until I land a certain trick. I will continue to the point where I'm basically collapsing from exhaustion. I'll play a video game until I can beat a certain boss or whatever. I'll set alarms for myself for when I need to stop and I'll blow through them every time. I always tell myself just one more try but it never is. Part of my brain tells me ""just stop, it's time to be done, it doesn't matter"" but the other part makes me furious at the thought of stopping before I achieve my stupid little goal. Sometimes this manifests as being unable to stop working on a productive task until it's complete. This problem makes me constantly later than I say I'm going to be and it's hurting my relationship.

148q64d,prior authorization üòê,"so my provider wanted to prescribe me vyvanse for binge eating (i had been tested at another place that said i didn‚Äôt have adhd, just ptsd. my provider was kind of skeptical of the report they sent her.). 

well, it required private authorization from my insurance, and basically, my insurance ended up saying i needed to try something cheaper first. 

ok, whatever. 

my provider said fine and wrote me a prescription for adderall under the premise of adhd treatment (she said she was allowed to disagree with the results from my test, so she wasn‚Äôt being shady.) i got that with no issues except regarding the shortage of adderall, but that‚Äôs kind of an issue for everyone lol. 

i took adderall and it was like the fog in my head cleared. it was so, so, incredibly wonderful. i finally felt okay after so many years of struggle. i went back for a check in appointment and told my provider all of this, and asked if i could be on the adderall that lasts longer though, because my current one was wearing off after like 5 hrs. 

she wrote me a prescription for adderall xr. no pharmacy had it in stock so i‚Äôve been without it for about a week now. once my pharmacy FINALLY got it in stock, they said it needed prior authorization from my insurance

so to sum it all up, i‚Äôm really confused on why another prior authorization is needed. i thought adderall was already the substitute medication because my provider originally wanted vyvanse.

i just feel really frustrated and upset because i finally found something that made me function normally, and it‚Äôs been taken away.

I have been having trouble with my mental health for a long time now. I go to therapy and have gone for 4 years now. I am consistent and I take my pills everyday. I just dont know what to do sometimes, last quarter I had a major depressive episode and I couldn't eat or get out of bed. Of course, I eventually got out of it. But I dont think I'm fully present sometimes. My parents support wavers often, One of my parents just got surgery, and we live in a 1 bedrm apt for a family of 4 one of them being a toddler. In complete honesty, I haven't had to take care of my parent much, but as a family unit we're not the best and its hard to emotionally deal. I know this sounds awful and selfish, but the surgery came at a bad time especially because the parent figure acts more like a child than an adult in general. I'm so close to finals and finding a quiet spot without interruptions has been difficult. I want to know if asking for an extension is fair in this situation. However, my chemistry professor low key hates me because I've taken his class 3 times already. I really hate myself because things were going great but 2 weeks ago I had to deal with a problem and it emotionally triggered me to the maximum. In sum, these classes aren't extremely hard and my professors have been understanding multiple times but I just cant seem to pass. I do not want to make excuses or blame anyone.

1487o65,accidentally took my Vyvanse at night omg i have patients to see tomorrow,"Hi guys, the title pretty much sums it up. I went to take my usual nightly OCP but instead took 40 mg of Vyvanse. I panicked and then consumed 10 mg of melatonin. This was 30 minutes ago and since then have not felt an ounce of sleepiness. Has anyone done this before? I‚Äôm concerned about lack of sleep as I have patients to see tomorrow and I often have hand tremors and slight muscle weakness (i‚Äôm a dental student so this could really affect my work) when I am severely lacking sleep. Should I just cancel my procedures now or have any of you experienced this with no issues?

UPDATE: 

Hi everyone, first of all thank you for your words of encouragement and kind advice. It was an honest mistake; thank you for giving me grace and not attacking me for mentioning the whole patient thing. As expected, I didn‚Äôt sleep at all last night even after taking 10 mg of melatonin. I laid in the dark willing myself to sleep for a miserable 2 hours but got increasingly frustrated. I could also feel my heart racing, so I felt tired yet very excited at the same time. I then started to feel hot and sweat because my heart was beating like I had just done a workout. I also had a feeling that if I did somehow fall asleep, I‚Äôd probably just wake up again in an hour or two, which made the concept of sleep seem even less worthwhile as time passed. All of this happening = no sleep for me. I looked through all the pictures in my camera roll from 2013 to 2017 in the meantime (no particular reason to stop at 2017, my alarm just rang at 6:30 and 2017 is as far as I got).

Anyways, I was able to get a faculty in my GPG to take my patients on for me. I am super lucky to have supportive faculty because I was getting really REALLY nervous about calling in- I absolutely hate disappointing people, especially my dental faculty and patients. I had really terrible thoughts as I stayed up in bed about how this would tarnish my reputation, make me seem unprofessional and unreliable, like I‚Äôm not good enough, etc. Side note: I always thought I was just a generally pessimistic person but I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I perhaps have general anxiety too. 

I emailed my GPG leads around 3AM about my general situation and how I was concerned about my capacity to provide care, and didn‚Äôt receive a response so I went to clinic this morning to speak to them in person (it‚Äôs likely they don‚Äôt check their emails on clinic days). I did feel very weak (like I had to sit down in the shower kind of weak) and a bit dizzy when I got out of bed this morning. I decided not to take another Vyvanse as someone below suggested, since I took my first one yesterday around 1PM (I forgot to take it in the morning) and then the accidental one at midnight. Taking another one would mean I‚Äôd have consumed 120 mg in around 18 hours. So I just ate a fiber one bar and had a coffee. Both attending faculty were so nonchalant over it and offered to take over my two cases without me even having to ask. I don‚Äôt even know why I stressed so much. They didn‚Äôt even try to make me feel guilty about it. 

I ended up staying and acted as an assistant for the day, which involved helping the Dr. by taking down pt notes and inputting them into Axium, suctioning saliva, drying teeth, locating supplies, and cleaning the operatories and returning supplies to the dispensaries once finished. I took the remaining half of the day off because around noon I was getting really tired and sleepy. I‚Äôm now back home, had a random remaining burst of energy so I just finished walking my dogs and had a good lunch! Now I‚Äôm back in bed to take a nap. Thankfully no clinic tomorrow. Many thanks for sticking around this long if you‚Äôre still here! Tomorrow is a new day :) 

TLDR: I went to clinic to explain my situation to my GPG and one of my attending faculty took over my cases while I assisted him, essentially just suctioning saliva, using the air syringe to dry teeth, and being the tool-grabber-and-hander person. I at least feel good about showing up and helping even if there was no tooth cutting for me today. Went home at lunch time and am now back in bed to regain my energy. Thanks for reading :)",74
1483401,(Every) medication stops working,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm just starting on medication again after several years off of it, and I‚Äôm having a very strange, and very frustrating problem with my medication. I‚Äôm hoping someone else here can point me in the right direction, or at least has had the same problem at some point. If not, at least you guys will understand how frustrated and angry this is making me.

I was diagnosed with ADHD in high school and was on medication consistently for a couple of years. It was a huge help, a night and day difference in my concentration. But around my senior year, it started to become less effective, and then to have more or less the opposite effect of what it was supposed to have‚Äî I felt tired and clouded and like I couldn‚Äôt concentrate on anything outside of myself. I don‚Äôt remember exactly which one I was on at the time, but I told my doctor about it and switched to something else. Then the same thing happened again‚Äî it worked really well at first, then got less and less effective, and then started doing what I said before. I‚Äôd feel like my head was stuffed full of cotton and just want to lie down until the medication had worn off.

I spent the next couple of years going through what seemed like every drug that can be prescribed for ADHD. I tried Concerta, a bunch of different instant and extended-release amphetamines, even modafinil. It was the same with all of them‚Äî they worked great at first, gradually stopped working, and then made me feel worse. And as time went on, this started to happen faster and faster. At first, they would work well for a week or two before their effectiveness started to fade, but after about a year I would only get a couple days of use before they stopped.

I tried everything I could think of that I thought might help. I tried exercising every day, taking long breaks in between taking medication, every supplement I could find that had any research at all suggesting it might help. None of it worked. Eventually, I decided I had to accept that medication wasn‚Äôt going to work for me, and that I‚Äôd just have to do the best I could without it. And of course, it turned out that ‚Äúthe best I could do‚Äù was not very good.

It‚Äôs been ~three or four years since then, and so I recently decided I‚Äôd give medication another go. About a month ago, I started seeing a new doctor and got a prescription for adderall. And it was absolutely magical, I finally felt like the person I was supposed to be. I could actually work on the things I wanted to do instead of spending all my free time making a half-hearted attempt at my hobbies before having my attention inevitably pulled away by something else. Words cannot express how profound a difference it made for me. I finally felt hopeful for my future in a way hadn‚Äôt in a long time.

Then, after a couple weeks, it started to get less effective, and as of the last few days, I think I‚Äôm firmly in the ‚Äúcounterproductive‚Äù stage. I took my most recent dose yesterday, and I still feel like shit. I‚Äôm tired and can barely concentrate on anything, and of all things, my eyes ache. I‚Äôm going to talk to my doctor about switching to ritalin the next time I see him, but I‚Äôm not optimistic about that working long-term either.

I‚Äôm at the end of my rope here. I would give my right hand to be able to just take medication for the rest of my life and not worry about it doing this shit, but I really don‚Äôt have any idea where to go from here. I‚Äôve tried talking to doctors about this, but I think by and large they haven‚Äôt really believed me.

Has anyone else had this problem? ~~please? anyone?~~",1
148u0r9,How long did it take you to graduate college?,"I know there are tons of posts asking this and believe me I've looked through a whole lot of them, but I've just been so slumped about this I need advice or anything from anyone who thinks like me at this point. I was ""supposed"" to transfer to the UC I planned on transferring to this fall but I am pretty sure I'm getting suspended instead </3 I am honestly just sooo fucking tired. It's the same cycle every semester. I only recently got diagnosed and prescribed adderall but that was in the middle of the last semester and it didn't solve all my problems like I naively thought it would so I ended up failing half my classes!! Again!! I didn't think I needed more help than I got but it's gotten to the point my professor (bless her soul) insist I talk with the DSPS so I can go into a quiet room during exams. I genuinely did not think it got to that point until my final exam where I found myself looking around the room at all the focused faces and silently tearing up wishing I could just be normal like them. No one else was distracted by the slightest sound of a page turning or person breathing or looking out the window and losing track of time. I'm just so lost... it's gonna take me probably 6 years just to transfer now that I'm getting suspended. It's that and the constant missing assignments because I lose track of time - and not just a couple hours but fucking days of time. I don't remember what I did, I forget if I did something, I forget what day it is, I get distracted too easily and hyperfocus on the most useless tasks. It's so frustrating, I just want to be normal. I know I can learn but it's just so hard to. AND I can't get financial aid because of my low gpa :') I feel like such a fucking waste of space and everything is telling me to quit.

Please someone tell me it gets better; it took me two years to accept the fact community college was a better choice for me, but now I'm just so upset entering my third year at junior college and still being the same failure I was when I started. What resources at my school can help me? Can I even be helped üò≠

148ts85,"Monday perfect, Tuesday a disaster","Hello all, 

Today was my breaking point where I am deciding to seek meds. I took some in High School but have since stopped and Im breaking down. I've been stuck in my hometown with very few friends for five years at 22 years old. Had a massive panic attack in April over some bullshit I created in my mind and left for Italy for a month. Just incredible, meeting new people every day and seeing the most breathtaking places. Now back home again and I feel despair, see one friend maybe once a week. Other than that I work in a factory with people twice my age. 

I leave for college in a month but I am falling off the rails. Monday started great, got locked onto a routine and did most of my chores and worked out. BUT today I could not focus on anything, felt like a war was going on in my head the entire shift. One side wanting me to run out of the building. Got home and attempted to do chores but no luck, I even deleted all social media apps off my phone. Still I just ended up playing Guitar and Piano for 2 hours to try and calm my mind down. I am going so crazy sitting around here that I am planning to go camping in the mountains 2 hours away just to taste some novelty. I was diagnosed with ADHD, Depression and Anxiety at 8 years but I could very well have something else. My parent's pumped me full of medication at that young age which fucked me up worse and left me jaded to the idea ever since. Wellbutrin helped me the most in high school so I will try and get prescribed this before I leave for school.

148qwv2,Cigarettes and ADHD,"Hi, 

I've been taking a large dose of methylphenidate for a few weeks or a couple of months (54mg +) and it changed things significantly for me. I used to be on large doses of depressants, stimulants, cannabis, etc. When I first started taking this it changed my life and got me off every drug I'd been addicted to.

I spent a while weening myself off of cannabis (surprisingly the hardest one for me?), and ever since I started taking methyl, I cannot stop smoking. I literally have to schedule when I have cigarettes and how many now. I know it could be addiction transferrance, but for some reason it feels extremely good to smoke ONLY when I've had my methylphenidate. Odd thing, but I was wondering if this is perfectly normal or if someone else has had some similar experience?",2

Has anyone experienced this? And was it fixed with more experimentation with dosage?

148tgum,Is it too ambitious to be extra busy when you have adhd?,"I (F, 29) recently decided to take my ADHD treatment more seriously, so I am starting back with meds and supplements and exercise and strategies and therapy. Although meds haven't kicked in because i need a higher dose, everything else i am doing is working and I have improvements every day. 

Now in addition to all the ADHD trestment things I'm doing I have a regular job, the goal to be succesful Stand Up comedian, and recently took on a second part time job. I decided to pause going to open mics  so I could focus on ADHD treatment and starting the new job. My behavioural therapist suggested I continue to write comedy in order to have a creative output, as much as possible. And I agree with her but I am afraid I am too busy and will end up burning myself out. Another one of my therapists said that many people have multiple jobs and study and do fine, for limited amounts of time for specific goals. My goal with this new job is just to become rich and transition to a more flexible schedule so that I can have more free time for stand up comedy. It's such a good opportunity: it pays almost 5√ó as much as I am earning on my regular job. But its a sales job and you only get comissions. So that's why I haven't quit my regular job. I want to have at least some savings and the certainty that I will be good at this sales job. Being so busy, I am so afraid of losing friendships, or becoming burned out, or that the ADHD treatment doesn't work due to not resting enough etc. I expressed this to my  behavioural therapist and she did say that we have to be cautious not to overload ourselves. 

And I am just curious whether there has been anyone with ADHD that was super busy, and with proper treatment (or without it) was able to make it. Or is part of accepting you ADHD and its treatment just accepting you are only ever going to be able to do 1 thing at a time?",0
148tfva,Best medication treatment video app.,"Hello, I've recently learned of the app Done. And cerebral. I was interested in the Done. App first.

But are also half the cost. I do feel I keep a stimulant as I doom scroll, and know I need to do things but don't do them. Have a hard time socializing. Especially focusing and getting work done around others. I can't motivate myself without using my phone at the same time to keep me motivated.

148tcj0,Screen time addiction,"I‚Äôve always wondered why I felt my phone was so dangerous. I can spend all day in my bed without eating or even drinking water. I‚Äôve thought about creating apps that make it impossible to access a certain password (e.g. screen time passcode, social media logins, etc.) unless the user does a lot of boring tasks, or watches a bunch of ads, etc. Unfortunately this would be difficult to implement as there are always ways to bypass the restrictions and re-create the passcodes. There went my dream app‚Ä¶ 

So how do you deal with screen addiction? I‚Äôve tried to just not use my phone at all and stare at the wall, thinking about whatever crosses my mind, and this has actually worked a few times, but for some reason I always fall asleep and as soon as I wake up I get on my phone again. Or eventually I find some ‚Äúgood‚Äù reason to use my phone, and little by little I return to the same non-stop addictive scrolling and commenting.

I‚Äôve heard that instruments can help, I‚Äôm thinking about buying a guitar. I try to do a ‚Äúdopamine fast‚Äù but I always feel like I‚Äôm just wasting time, not being productive, and ironically this mindset just results in me wasting time on my phone instead.

148t3jo,Neuropsychological exam?,"Vyvanse isn't working for me anymore, but my doc said that instead of switching to a methylphenidate family drug (like all the research I've read suggests if one stimulant class doesn't work for you), she would go with a non-stimulant or make me get a neuropsychological test. She said if one class of stimulants isn't working that the protocol is for her to see a neuropsychological test before switching me to another one. The wait time is 6-8 months through their clinic and since I have Medicaid, any provider that doesn't take my insurance can't legally take payment from me. It seems the wait time is about this long for anywhere taking Medicaid. I'm not sure what else I can do besides get on Strattera, even though I have heard far more research indicating that non-stimulants are less effective than stimulants and that if one stimulant medication doesn't work to try the other family.

It doesn't seem right to me to need a neuropsychological test to switch medications, especially after already receiving a diagnosis. I thought that's what all the paperwork and interview was upon diagnosis, but I guess this is more in-depth and is testing cognitive abilities...

Does anyone have any feedback? Thoughts? Experience going from one drug class to another (amphetamine to methylphenidate or vice versa?)",1
148syip,How to have hope,"TLDR; strategies for staying hopeful in bleakkkk times 
and 
A few months ago, I started a miserable job, obviously not knowing it would be. I don‚Äôt want to slander the company or lose my job, so I‚Äôll just say, I rent important things to people who need them! This makes me sound crazy, but I usually LOVE customer service (have done it forever), and I used to believe that people are inherently kind and supportive of one another. But after only having this job awhile, I am losing all faith that humanity is good in any way. Every customer is rude or at baseline always offended that they have to pay for the service we offer. They roll their eyes at me if I make a mistake for one second and then fix it. They completely disrespect and destroy what we rent with no regard for the others who need it. 

So sure, humans suck, no surprise. But that was all I had. Climate change is happening. We are killing our planet and our animals one by one, and there is nothing I can do to stop this. I‚Äôve even tried SO MUCH to get involved with some local issues related to this recently and found out the red tape is INSANE where I live and apparently our state is just killing our planet at an alarming rate with no concern.

And any hope I have of me changing anything or living an amazing life despite this all is shredded because I have ADHD and meds haven‚Äôt been successful and I have the memory of a goldfish and mess anything up any chance I get. And I don‚Äôt want kids. And relationships are just always toxic for my mental health at some point, so I tend to stay out of them. 
So like what hope is there? 

Pleaaaase share your strategies for staying hopeful in SUCH bleak times and with the whole ‚ÄòADHD making me feel like an indecisive failure who won‚Äôt accomplish anything great or meaningful‚Äô thing. Like how do you cope with the world being on fire? LIKE EVEN LITERALLY- CANADA IS ON FIRE.",3
148swt1,therapist said I should try and get assessed (again),"I'm in the UK, about a year ago I tried going to my gp and asking for an assessment, got rejected on the basis of ""the criteria for being put on the waiting list excludes people that managed to get to uni"".

My therapist said this happens because they try and put people off because the NHS doesn't have money and waiting lists are long. She says I should try and insist. Thing is, if waiting lists are long why should I even try? I might not even be in the country by the time I'm at the top of the waiting list. Plus, it sounds like in my area its so bad they have decided to make a clear cut-off (no people in higher education).

Idk, should I even bother and try going again, considering making an appointment requires so much executive functioning and stress? But also considering symptoms keep getting worse even though my coping skills keep getting better lol

148sk6f,Medication questions regarding dopamine huntnig,"edit: dopamine \*hunting\* as in ""hunting for dopamine hits""

Hi there -

I was diagnosed as a child, but my parents never sought medication or treatment of any kind. They let me drink soda and said ""caffeine seems to help."" Make of that what you will...

In 2016, as an adult, I got a diagnosis from an ADHD clinic. The guy giving me the test said he knew within 30 seconds of talking to me that I had ADHD. Haha.

Anyhow, I tried medication (I don't remember what kind and I lost the record) and felt like it wasn't helping with the things I hoped/thought/assumed medication was supposed to help with. I was definitely taking a high enough dose to make a difference, but it wasn't making my job any easier. That felt like a life lesson for me to not have impossible standards for myself, which was good, but I still felt like I was struggling.

In true ADHD fashion, I didn't think ""hmm I'll talk to my ADHD speciality about trying a different medication and/or different approaches."" I just stopped taking medication and pretty much forgot about the whole process. Money was probably part of the issue. Years later I thought ""wait maybe I should try different medication"" but my doctor had retired at that point and I lost the paper trail proving my diagnosis or however that works. So I knew I'd have to go through the diagnosis process again, which also costs money at the moment.

Now I'm in a career that *kind of* lets me cater to my ADHD - I make educational videos in an area where I'm kind of an expert and I'm self employed, too. It kind of works for me, except on days when my brain doesn't work and I just can't seem to focus on anything.

Ok, wow, getting to the point, sorry.

I quit smoking cigarettes in 2020 and basically traded cigarettes for snacking which seems to be pushing me into a new unhealthy territory.

This leads to my questions for the community:

***Does medication help with the desperate craving for stimulation all the time? Ie snacking, watching youtube while working or cooking or showering?***

***How long did it take you to develop better methods staying organized once you started medication? What kinds of things still take a lot of effort and what kinds of things seem magically easier?*** I am incredibly disorganized right now. It feels impossible for me to stay organized during any process and it takes a lot of mental effort to organize anything.

***What, specifically, do you feel that medication helps with when it comes to something like writing a paper, reading a book, critically listening to instructions, and other stuff like that?***

***Do you feel a difference in depression and anxiety levels when taking medication?***

I feel like sometimes I can think and work just fine and other times my brain is so foggy I can barely function.

***Are other things working for you besides medication?***

***Do you find that medication allows you to have more on your plate?*** I feel like I can NOT handle what ought to be a normal amount of things in a week: work, meals, plans with friends, chores.

I guess this is kind of a rant, but my questions are genuine. I guess I'm wondering if my medication experience was a fluke, or if I was focusing on the wrong aspects of my life while I was on it, or if I didn't take it for long enough (I think 3 months?). It's a brain fog day and I can usually write better. I'm hoping you all understand.",2

148rwfm,I‚Äôm unmedicated as fuhhh right now,"To start off my pharmacy skimped me on 2.5 days worth of medication cause they‚Ä¶just didn‚Äôt have it. That was a month ago. So I haven‚Äôt been on medication for about three days. 

It feels like I just ‚Äúdon‚Äôt work‚Äù. I feel like a freakin broken electronic. All I have been doing is oversleeping, getting up to have breakfast and then taking a nap. I feel depressed, not crazy depressed.

So today is my appointment and my doctor didn‚Äôt call. I called and he didn‚Äôt pick up. He is only in the office twice a week. I was able to fax him because he‚Äôs major old school. I legit hope he is okay but I‚Äôm also on like day three of feeling like poop. 

What‚Äôs the longest you‚Äôve gone unmedicated and what were your symptoms?  I‚Äôm really beginning to freak out that something happened to him and I‚Äôll never get my medication again. As dumb as that sounds. 

The only good thing is I have a comorbidty. OCD!  So no matter what I get my ass up, showered and into some clean clothes but I can‚Äôt do some of the things I know I have to and I‚Äôm going nuts!",2
148rvlp,Worried about getting a diagnosis,"So about two years ago I mentioned to my mom that I'd like to be evaluated for ADHD. For my whole life I've struggled with attention issues in school and at home. I was constantly forgetting to do homework assignments, struggling to complete them because I couldn't stay focused long enough, forgetting to do chores, leaving the front door unlocked all night after walking the dog, losing keys, losing phones, losing wallets, and so much more. My mom used to say that I'd lose my head if it wasn't attached to me. I dealt with behavior issues and impulse control when I was younger too which would get me in trouble a lot at school and at home. I'm talking grounded for more time out of the year than not. I have no sense of time. Hours can feel like days or minutes depending on what I'm doing and where I'm at. I can't approximate how long something will take accurately at all. I'm rarely ever ready to go anywhere on time and am always rushing to class, to practice, and even to go to the dining halls with my friends. To this day, I still struggle with forgetfulness, inattention, and impulse control (losing car keys, messing up at work, getting into car accidents, struggling with completing school work, etc. etc.) which makes me feel like a helpless kid all the time. I've also noticed that I struggle with navigating social situations and maintaining relationships, but for the sake of brevity I won't get too much into that.   


But anyways, two years ago, before I started college, I told my mom that I thought I might have ADHD and that a lot of the stuff that I had been reading and learning about the disorder was lining up with the experiences I had and am still having. I thought that a chance at a diagnosis would be helpful for me before going out to live on my own at college. She told me that she didn't think I had ADHD mainly because I did very well in school and although I struggled with a range of different issues, my grades never really suffered. She attributed a host of my other issues to being an irresponsible kid. \[Important to note that this isn't to say anything bad about my mom, she's a great mom. I just happen to disagree with her on this because I don't think she understands my experience\]. After some talking about it she did set up an online meeting with some sort of mental health professional, but nothing really came out of it. The guy asked me one question about ADHD, but mostly wanted to talk about my parent's recent divorce and wanting to see if that had any affect on how I was thinking. 

I'm currently going into my third year of college, and I am still struggling with a lot of the same issues as I was in middle school and high school. This past semester had been very tough on me. I'm a film major with a concentration in scriptwriting and an English minor, so a lot of my work revolves around writing. As much as I love it, it's one of my most difficult tasks. Between stopping every 5 minutes because my brain needs me to do something else, giving up easily when I hit a stump, needing to have the tv on in the background for background noise while at the same time not being able to truly focus with the tv on, and so much more. With the amount of writing I had to do this semester, schoolwork was agonizing, and I know it's only going to get worse. I was always letting big assignments pile up, then staying up till 2 in the morning to get them done when the deadline gave me no other choice. I was barely getting any sleep because I also play soccer at school and had to wake up at 5 am almost every day for practice. This is something I don't know if I can survive another year dealing with. 

All this is to say that I feel like I need to talk to someone about considering a diagnosis or just figuring out how to deal with these issues, but after what happened last time, I'm afraid to bring it up to my mom again. It took a lot of courage to bring it up to her in the first place, and part of the reason I think it didn't go well is because I didn't advocate for a real diagnosis hard enough with her or the guy she set up the meeting with. To be honest, I'd rather just be able to do it myself without anyone else, but that doesn't seem probable from what I've looked up. This is my first time posting here and I'm kind of just looking for anything - advice, support, or whatever.",1
148rrvu,I Hate That ADHD Applies To Things I LOVE Doing,"I‚Äôve been trying to pursue content creation more seriously as I‚Äôm starting to build an audience, but for a long time I haven‚Äôt been able to be at all consistent.

There‚Äôs a sort of piece of advice a lot of larger creatives give, and that‚Äôs that you shouldn‚Äôt try to go into this field if you don‚Äôt want to. I know I want to, but I feel powerless, and every moment I don‚Äôt get something done, I worry people assume that I‚Äôm lazy or not passionate about what I do.

148rqm1,The difference between 1.slowly easing into a consistent habit and 2.going full throttle only to then burn out.,"**rant**
Ugh I just hate how the easiest way to form a consistent habit is to slowly ease into something. But my ADHD brain just wants to dive right into the deep end and only stay there for a few weeks before inevitably failing. 

For example for years I've wanted to consistently go to the gym. Ever so often I would start going to the gym and doing 2.5 hour sessions every day for about 4 weeks and then just become understandably burnt out. 
I have also done this with running
Reading books
Learning new languages
My diet
My Uni work 
The list goes on and on 

I ask myself when will this God awful cycle end and the honest truth is that It problably never will. 

This was mainly just a rant but have any of you guys every actually managed to stick a habit even after you dived into the deep end?",3
148rkfk,Self Therapy for ADHD?,"So I was discussing DBT for my BPD with my therapist, when I asked about adding some CBT for my ADHD.

I‚Äôm a little bummed about not having her help lol. 

Are there any resources or CBT workbooks you guys were able to use _by yourselves_? 

Or should I go to a different therapist? I really do like this one, we clicked really nicely from the first sitting but I‚Äôm not sure this was a good response from her side.",1

I have a very particular problem. I'm based in South-East Europe and my country really just doesn't have experts for adults with ADHD.

To make the irony more insane, I am a psychologist, I've known I have ADHD for a while but I don't have access to the experts I would like to speak to.

Does anyone have any information/advice on foreign experts who consult internationally/remotely.

I would both like to get an official diagnosis and have a chance to go into therapy with someone experienced in working with adults with ADHD.

148rbre,Overwhelmed with discouragement. Everything feels impossible,"I try to do things, work towards things, tell myself to find solutions and work harder. And it all just crashes and burns. By the end I‚Äôm just sitting here stuck, everything out of reach. I‚Äôve found a great way of describing it though. It‚Äôs like the inside of my mind is a hoarder‚Äôs house with multiple tvs playing in different rooms. Boxes and junk everywhere, some of them are important, but I can‚Äôt get rid of any of them. Then I‚Äôll try to do something, and I can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs no free space on the tables or the benches, no where to sit down, no quiet room where you can focus. On the outside it just looks like I‚Äôm sitting around because I‚Äôm lazy, but really I‚Äôm paralysed, just standing there in my head overwhelmed completely unable to do anything to the quality I wanted. Maybe I‚Äôm being a little dramatic, but that‚Äôs part of the problem. I‚Äôm trying to take these art classes online, while I‚Äôm in them I‚Äôm a little better. Can‚Äôt focus for the life of me but I‚Äôm at least motivated to do something. I get into this energised headspace where I impulsively make flimsy plans to be more creative and like myself again. Then the class is over, and the discouragement slowly comes crashing in, and I‚Äôm reminded of the mess in my head and how impossible my dreams feel. And despite a diagnosis I still can‚Äôt help but think I‚Äôm just not trying hard enough, that I‚Äôm just an inconvenience, that I need to do something different and I‚Äôm not good enough.

148r8vq,I tested for medication,"I was pretty angry when my psychiatrist didn‚Äôt show up to my appointment this morning. I woke up at eleven took my meds and waited for 1 hour for her. She didn‚Äôt pick up nor emailed me but I‚Äôm able to see she was present and was picking up others calls. 

Regardless I ended up angry and just had a lot of emotions at once and was confused of why she wouldn‚Äôt pick me up. After three more hours of waiting she went offline. So no chance she was going to and so I called the clinic to reschedule and im going to see her tomorrow. 


Wellll today I decided to go get a drug test because I really don‚Äôt feel my medication at fucking all. I swear these are sugar pills or diluted. 
I bought the test, used it, and waited. 

After awhile I placed a timer and went to my phone and searched up many different things until I realized I take other medications such as a antipsychotic and antidepressant. Turns out the second one is also likely to show up on my drug test as positive for amp aka adderall. So regardless it would be hard to say for sure if the meds are in my system or if my antidepressant is showing a false result. 
And I‚Äôm low key pissed about it. 
Wasted 39.49 dollars just to get a positive and to realized it could be a false positive but I literally can not find out.

148r8rd,Lazy cooking!,"Hungry Girl 6-Ingredient Meals, my friends.  These recipes are mostly designed to take no time at all and use very few (& very common) ingredients. üëçüëç

I used to enjoy cooking. Now, it feels like just another chore. But we're trying to eat healthier & exercise more.

So I made a really simple Enchilada & Tortilla Chicken Breast entr√©e tonight and my son & husband are so appreciative.  It was really good!

Spray pan. Preheat to 350¬∞. Sprinkle thin-sliced chicken breasts with a bit of chili powder & cumin to taste. Smear with a coating of pre-made red enchilada sauce.  Bake until chicken cooked. (Really thin sliced chicken breast cutlets are maybe 15 minutes.)  Take out chicken.

Crunch up some Tortilla chips and Sprinkle chicken.

Switch to broil and move up rack. Broil 2 minutes until tortillas just browned. 

There's also one pan clean-up! ‚ù§Ô∏è

148r4ky,Does ADHD distort ability to judge cost/benefit?,"Hey folks, a thought occurred to me today that maybe what holds me back from getting things done is an inability to estimate the benefit of doing something. For example, I've played guitar for years, and ~~I'm pretty good~~  I don't entirely suck at it. People often tell me they envy me because playing music comes so naturally to me; and yet, I am always keenly aware of how much effort it would take to become truly proficient at it. Never mind the 80/20 rule; it's as though that last 20% would take a 200% effort, and I just can't convince myself that it's worth it. And it's like that with so many things that I've tried: piano, painting, writing, karate (although with the latter, along with any kind of sport, there is a whole other set of issues going on that would need a separate post to go into). 

Executive functioning seems to be something that sucks up a lot of energy, which is a finite resource for me. After a full day of teaching, where I've had to make hundreds of decisions and regulate the impulses and emotions of 30 students, I have nothing left and I can't even decide what to make for dinner. So a lot of stuff just doesn't get done--and one big area of my life where nothing gets done is pursuing any of my creative endeavours. 

It's a vicious cycle--I don't see myself as capable of attaining proficiency in something, so I redirect the time and energy toward work and *maybe* household chores, so of course I don't make any progress, so there's no payoff, so more cutbacks, and so on. 

Breaking down tasks and committing to the first little step is one thing; but how do you convince yourself that it's worth doing at all?",2

Since the beginning of the 2nd year of my PhD I have been struggling with poor motivation, concentration, keeping to plans and keeping to deadlines (as well as general poor executive functioning). As a result, I am extremely behind on both of my experimental and written work and am falling further and further behind every week. For context by now I should have at least 3 chapters drafted (I barely have one) and have yet to complete most of my experimental work (I have only completed one chapters worth and I should have 4). 

Over the past 7 months in particular, I have barely made it into the office (no matter how many times I tell myself to or how much I want to) and every time I try to even think about what I need to do I get overwhelmed to the point that I get nothing done resulting in me being unable to finish the chapter I am working on and my experiments to be delayed (my PhD is in STEM). In all honesty, most days nowadays I can barely get myself to get out of bed and any form of self care, chores or even hobbies feel impossible (no matter how much I want to do them) let alone my PhD work. I would take some time off however, I have already taken three months off during my 2nd year, for what I thought was depression, and I cannot take any more until early October at the earliest. In all honesty I didn't feel ready to come back but I wasn't (and am still not) in a position financially to go part time or suspend my studies (which would either reduce or temporarily freeze my stipend that I need for bills/ rent/ food etc.).

My supervisors have been kept aware of my issues throughout and have suggested I try and get a further extension (I already have a funding and deadline extension to make up for my previous period of medical leave) however this is likely to be unfunded and I am not in a position financially to cover the extra course/ research/ living costs. If anyone has any advice on what I should do next I would greatly appreciate it. This PhD is my dream project with my dream supervisor so I really don‚Äôt want to give it up.

148pti1,Medication change has me worried: Adderall XR to Strattera,"I am being switched from 15mg of Adderall XR to 40mg-80mg of Strattera. I am really confused on how I am supposed to take it, and side effects.

I raised the concern of my Adderall XR running out too early to my Dr. I would take it at 7 and by 11am-12 pm I'd start feeling spaced out and sleepy and unable to focus. I have to take it that early since it literally helps me get out of bed. But it doesn't last for my entire workday...

I asked her if I could get an increase in my dose since this wasn't a problem that I had before and I've been on 15mg for nearly a year. She told me she had concerns about side effects and would rather have me try a non-stimulant alternative to Adderall. (And methylphenidate hasn't worked for me in the past, rly bad side effects) 

I know nothing about Strattera and I asked her for more info but she didn't explain much to me. She just said it was a non stimulant and that it takes longer to kick in. I accepted in the moment cuz I was like sure, no harm in trying.

But now i'm super worried and anxious. I don't want to create a setback to all the progress i have achieved with managing my ADHD. I don't even know how to start this medication. Here are the reasons why i am worried.

1. She told me it was okay to start tomorrow (I took my meds today) and I'm worried since I know stimulants require time to get out of my system before other medications. Is it any different with Strattera? 

2. I've also been told to take 40mg (1 pill) for the first week, and increase to 80mg (2 pills) for the following weeks until the end of the month. Is that normal? For someone who's been on only stimulants, that sounds pretty high and it worries me.

3. Also, if anyone has positive experiences with Strattera, pls comment below. I feel like all I could find online about it is negative which makes me even more anxious about starting it :(",1

at this moment in life i feel stuck. im in a long relationship, and i feel like nothing really makes sense anymore. im constantly anxious and unhappy. has anyone felt this way before/during/after the diagnosis? it seems like i cant make up my mind about anything. do i wanna keep this relationship going? do i wanna break up? do i want to quit my job and find something else?

148pmyc,Started experimenting with taking my adderall with protein-powder shakes. Subtle but effective improvement. Thank you protein.,"i don't often like to eat a lot of food when I wake up, but i always take my meds first thing in the morning. I had a bag of whey protein (when i was trying to go to the gym to build muscle...then stopped...typical adhd lol) lying around, and I know that protein + adhd and protein + adderall = functional adhd person, so last few days i've been giving it a shot. I have tried taking it with my meds, and taking my meds first, then about an hour later drinking the shake. I use a scoop of powder + about a cup of almond milk. I think it's effective. I feel less variability in my day-to-day symptom management, on days when im not hungry, im getting something in my system, and i don't have a glucose crash 6 hours in. I work overnights, so it's been helpful in me not becoming super light headed and starving at 9pm (when i wake up at 3, but not hungry at all)  
I don't do dairy milk anymore as it goes bad way too fast, more so than i can drink it, and it just leaves a taste in my mouth that i don't like. Also my psych np told me that dairy products with amphetamines is a bad combo, something about decreased effectiveness (similar to vit. c). But im wondering if the dairy-based protein powder has the same component. I the bag is practically full, but im open to trying other alt-protein powders.",2
148pkpc,I found something that has skyrocketed my productivity this week!!,"EDIT: I just found a visualized version of it on YouTube! https://youtu.be/MVobZa369ks



Honestly, dealing with my ADHD has been a real challenge this year. I've felt pretty defeated and helpless, trying various methods that didn't seem to work. Lately, I've been going through the motions, feeling like my brain is constantly working against me. But then, out of the blue, something incredible happened last week. I stumbled upon a song that had a profound impact on my mind.

The song is called ""Eclosion"" by Tony Anderson, and it's been a game-changer for me. When I listened to it with my headphones on, something clicked. My mind became so clear and focused. I was able to tackle tasks like a champ! I responded to 50 emails, effortlessly folded my clothes, planned my meals for the whole week, and even found the mental space to process my thoughts and journal. It was like a breath of fresh air after months of struggling.

By the way, I've been using AirPods Pro initially, but they tended to fall out easily (and I'm always paranoid about losing them). So, I switched to Beats headphones, which have been more secure and allowed me to fully immerse myself in the music's effects.

If you're interested, I've created a Spotify playlist with similar songs that have a calming effect on my mind. It's my go-to collection for finding that peace and clarity. If you'd like, I can share the playlist with you. Just let me know, and I'll send you the link!

All in all, ""Eclosion"" by Tony Anderson has been a true Godsend for me. Similar to how 8D works this activates something in my brain. I‚Äôve tried Brown noise and that doesn‚Äôt work for me personally. 

It's also not just the productivity but its made me regain hope and confidence in managing my ADHD. I'm incredibly grateful for stumbling upon this song, and I genuinely hope it can bring the same sense of calm and focus to others who might be struggling.",5

148pgoo,Emotional after medicated?,"Hello, I‚Äôm in my last few years of school and I recently got medicated for ADHD after my first 15minute visit with a psychiatrist. They didn‚Äôt really tell me I had it, but they said they were going to prescribe me with the medication for it.  Then in a few weeks, they would prescribe me with medication for depression. Psychiatrist said longtime untreated ADHD probably caused my depression (I think my depression was due to a whole different issue though).  By the time I got it, I only had 2 weeks of school left, last one being finals week. 
I got medicated with Jornay PM (METHYLPHENIDATE HCL) 40mg.  They said  to take it once a day in the evening, which I‚Äôve done so far. 
Is it normal to feel overwhelmingly emotional and irritated at normal situations?  I tried to research online, but it usually says it‚Äôs because I was misdiagnosed and the medicine isn‚Äôt for me.  
After taking jornay, I‚Äôd attend school with a major headache and feeling nauseous when there‚Äôs a lot of noise or having to talk a great amount.  Everything that I would roll my eyes at now makes me somewhat upset. Just now, I lashed out at someone because they relayed some information wrong. But because I was so frustrated at that, I started crying. It‚Äôs not like sobbing crying, but the type where tears won‚Äôt stop and my nose starts running, but I can still talk (just with a shaky voice).  
Is this normal? Is my body just getting used to it?  The more I look online, the bigger I feel that I don‚Äôt have ADHD and it‚Äôs all in my head. To the point where I‚Äôm full of guilt because what if something I had thought was the problem, wasn‚Äôt even the real answer.  Prior to being medicated, I would hesitate to talk about my problems because I thought I was just making it up or looking for excuses. Now that I‚Äôve taken it, I feel like I was just lying to myself the entire time. 

Im not close with anyone to talk about this.  Parents are a no go; don‚Äôt talk with dad, mom makes my experiences all about her(how she struggled with worse). Siblings don‚Äôt share the same issue. Friends can‚Äôt understand and always dismissive when I mention something.   Psychiatrist is there, but my mom only took me there because she was friends with her. I don‚Äôt know if that violates anything, but she the only psychiatrist I can go to.  She‚Äôs nice, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how she‚Äôs friends with my mom, so it makes me very hesitant.",0

148paew,Need help advice post adhd assessment/results,"So I was diagnosed with dyslexia in 2019 at age 39 male. The psychiatrist said I possibly have both ADHD and dyslexia but he wasn't qualified to diagnose me. Realising I still struggle post dyslexia I started to look into ADHD. Tried getting referral on NHS during pandemic but they refused. Tried again in 2021 and finally got assessed 2 weeks ago. Had the decision given today and they said they can't diagnose me due me being undiagnosed dyslexia as a child. I ticked all the boxes of being adhd however the box saying is there any reason that another underlying issue might be the cause of the my sympton I failed on. They basically said if I was diagnosed as a child with dyslexia then they would be able to see if I still had symptoms post controlling my dyslexia.

I know I struggle with everyday things such as even trying to remember brushing my teeth. And these issues are nothing to do with me being dyslexic, I wish I never mentioned it, then obviously I would be dishonest. I tried reasoning with them but they made their final decision. They did say the committee was half in favour half not, but just because of this and one other minor thing my case was inconclusive. The minor thing is that I always excelled in maths because I enjoyed where apparently that's not something they generally see In an undiagnosed adhd person. I told them I enjoy math because uts like solving puzzles, otherwise I was very poor academically.

I feel I have no options left as I struggle with general chores, professional exams, career (getting projects done on time), showed them evidence, school reports. Like I said I ticked all the boxes for the symtons with clear evidence. She suggested it could be asd which I already looked into it and defo don't fit the bill. I seriously need help what I can do. I don't want to go thru an assessment again privately as it took an emotional toll going thru my life struggles. If I don't get help I feel like I might do something drastic.

I start hating everyone, I star feeling deeply lonely and sad, I want to cry, everything my mom says annoys me, I don't want to do anything, any option makes me sick, any tv show, any activity feels disgusting, any ideas I get from google or YouTube seem like bs. I start questioning if I even love my boyfriend, if he's even worth my time, if I even like him. Generally a feeling of life being too overwhelming (even if mine is privileged compared to others) and that participating in it is too much work and thinking that nothing is even worth it (not related to wanting to cs, if you can understand..).

I've lived a very, very good life with a lot of activities/fixations that have introduced me to amazing people and lead to a good amount of personal growth.  Of course this was all done before understanding I had ADHD.  Since diagnosis I've struggled with emotional control, and now a pretty brutal breakup from an amazing breakup.  Within the struggle I find myself comparing myself to my ex partner; who is an engineer, an artist and returning to grad school.  I'm a trades worker, and this has eaten me up a lot. 

I've realized through the breakup that my activities and work aren't going sustaining.  My work leads to minimal knew learning, and I'm depressingly bored.  The activities are still good, but I'm realizing they are enough to sustain me.  So I've decided to return to school, with the potential aim at grad school.

My partner gets very angry at me and cusses at me when I do this. I‚Äôve tried to explain that I‚Äôm not using my adhd as an excuse, but that I really do forget what I wanted to say and find it hard. I have worked on these impulses in communication and have gotten better, but it is still there.

I take full accountability that interrupting is rude and I need to work on it. But It really upsets me when they become angry, shouts and cusses.

I am 29 now. I always find myself oversharing with friends and even with coworkers. I am a terrible listener and inclined to tell stuff over and over again. I also think I become more and more clingy in my friendships because I don‚Äôt have many friends and I regret over sharing and try to make it up for it, if that makes sense. Most of the time I cannot handle even the smallest rejections from people. I did therapy on and off but it didn‚Äôt work out and I ended up quitting it. 

I was just wondering if you have any tips on how to work on yourself and navigate healthy friendships.",2
148njpw,Vyvanse and famotidine,I plan to ask the pharmacist as well (waiting for call back) but does anyone take famotidine and vyvanse?  I wasn‚Äôt sure if vyvanse interact with antacids the same way as adderall?  I was taking a different anti acid in the morning 2 hours before adderall per pharmacist instructions and didn‚Äôt notice any issues but my GI doc switched me to famotidine as needed throughout the day and just wondered if I should wait a certain amount of time in between.  Also wondering about tums & Rolaids,1
148ngjn,Corporate Job is soul-sucking,"It's so boring. It feels like my job is meaningless, and I could be gone, and it wouldn't matter.

There is no purpose except profit and ""continuous"" improvement.

It pays extremely well, and it's not hard. It's at home and super flexible with 25 days off a year + Holidays.

But I'm still not satisfied. 

I want to make a difference, do something I enjoy; I want more satisfaction.

But I also don't want to give up my lifestyle. It seems most jobs that would excite me (teaching, hospitality, etc.) pays awfully. 

Does anyone relate to my conundrum?",17
148nfqj,How Many mgs of Concerta Before it is Useful Again?,"I was initially prescribed 18 mg of Methylphenidate and I think it was useful in the beginning, I was more sharp, making less mistakes and able to recall things like names much easier.  After 4 cycles, it started losing its magic so decided to increase the dosage in increments starting with 27 mg and then 36 mg and not feeling like its making a difference or preserving the effect it was getting from it from when I first started taking it.  Do I need to increase the dosage wayyy more or switch to something more potent like Adderal?",0
148n2l7,"""You can't have ADHD and be an achiever, so you don't. Probably just low self-esteem"" - Psychiatrist.","Ive had imposter syndrome since the diagnosis, battling myself whether its all in my head or I do have it. I asked another psychiatrist today and tried to explain that yeah Im successful but I don't feel the normal successful, it takes twice the effort. Not because I dont pay attention, I do, but Im smart, so I pay attention till the point comes across then block everything else. I cram stuff in the last minute, and I spew it all on the paper. 

Thing is, I got a cognitive assessment, my attention was average/unimpaired and my working memory was above average. So now, Im thinking maybe everyone is right. Im not ADHD, im delusional because I feel different. 

As a kid, I wasnt hyperactive, actually all teachers loved me for being so ""polite and well-behaved"" for how I ""barely talked"". But thats the thing, I did all that to be accepted. To follow the rules out of fear. I also struggled with friends, I had no reason to talk when I was scared and was friends with like 2 kids. At home, when Id play alone, Id build worlds and stuff to entertain. In exams when i finished early, Id imagine monsters and stuff in class cause I hated revision; too boring. In class, I always doodled, sometimes I imagined my favourite character or another *me* dancing around or talking to me. But I always managed to tune in till I understood whatever is said and move on. I was gifted, I guess, it is actually boring when something doesnt challenge me. 

Now, im at uni, still do the same but I struggle cause I still have that fear of following rules. So I never miss deadlines and get good grades, but I stay up all night, I only study right before the exam, im always steps behind in projects, I forget chores at home, I never arrive to lectures on time or anywhere for that matter, im still always in my head and constantly on auto pilot. Ive had the wii mii theme music on in my mind for 2 weeks now and Im going crazy. I cant sleep, I cant wake up, eating is boring, peeing is too much work, etc. 

But Im successful, so, does that mean I really cant have it? Im scared, cause if I dont then, I really just suck because I suck in daily stuff.",203
148l251,I. Am. Paralyzed.,"I have so very much to do. And I have so  very much on my damn plate. And I'm overwhelmed. And sad. And frustrated.

1. I have lost my f/t hours at my job. The guy with whom I'd be sharing 3 of my shifts with has decided that I am absolutely horrible to work with. Three hours into my first shift with him he called my boss and complained about me saying that I was refusing to focus and that I was defensive about the training. I was gutted. 
   1. This isn't the first time I have heard these two things about myself in work environments. There is a disconnect between my intentions and my actions because I do not feel defensive at all. I am trying really fucking hard to show that I'm capable. That I'm going to do a good job. And it presents EVERY time as me being a jerk, apparently. So then, I get terrified to do or say anything because I'm not sure how to change my behavior so that I don't present as defensive. I may not seem like I'm focused, but I'm learning the stuff when I'm allowed to do it. But the  dude told me I had to shadow him and just watch him do it. I tried to explain to him that I wasn't going to learn a thing until I was allowed to do it, make my mistakes, and fix them. I have to do a task the ""forward"" way, and then if I do make a mistake, I won't ever make that mistake again because I will learn the reasons for the steps of the task by fixing the mistake. AKA learning it backwards too.  When the boss told me that (We'll call him Dwight because he is exactly like Dwight from The Office)-when my boss told me that Dwight had called him, I was all, I'm not the only one that Dwight treats like this (which is true, no one else wants the shift that I just got cut from because no one wants to work with him)-and my boss said that Dwight wasn't the only person that was saying this about me. That all of my new colleagues were saying this. About which I was gutted.  And then after that I was scared, terrified, to go back. So a person who had been training me before had just been diagnosed with covid. So I lied and said I had covid. My doctor put my on Ativan because I had one of my panic attacks in front of her. I'm so disappointed in myself for being someone that people don't like to work with. 
   2. Because I missed work with ""covid"" I needed to cover the graveyard shift for 4 days. At the end of that 4 days  I messaged my boss and said, so I forgot to print out the schedule, I assume I'll be on swing shift this next week. His response was no that he just wanted me to do two graveyards shifts on the weekend because he needed to hire a supervisor to mediate swing shift when he isn't there. 
   3. SOOO now my hours have been cut. My rent is due in 4 days and I don't have the money for it. 
   4. I'm getting a therapy animal but I'm afraid now to tell my landlord because even though they can't kick me out for that, they CAN kick me out for being late on rent. 
   5. I'm trying to get disability so I'm actually not supposed to earn more that 1470/mo while I wait to be approved. 
   6. I live in a hotel. 
   7. my room is a fucking gross disgusting disaster. I have to clean it before I get the animal. I started to. But because I'm just freaking overwhelmed and scared about money and rent and also I owe everyone in my family several thousands of dollars so I can't ask for help anymore. 
   8. OH and I forgot to sign up for a wait list lottery for housing assistance. because of my fucking ADHD. I tried to do it the day it opened but it was so overwhelmed with traffic I couldn't get through so I was going to do it later and forgot about it completely.
   9. I am pretty sure I'm trans and I am going to want top surgery but my insurance won't cover it unless I quit smoking-and I have to not even use nicotine therapy-I have to be without nicotine for at least 6 months before they will even consider me for surgery.  I have been smoking since I was 10. Why? because I was a girl-a very smart girl-with very controlling and abusive parents-so I was FLAMING ADHD but masked SO WELL that I had to seek stimulants somewhere and my parents smoked so I was able to sneak them and not be noticed. I don't mean to excuse the self-medication, that's just what many of us do. I mean I was also in the country and in the 70s/80s so no one was ADHD-they were either brilliant at masking, or were ""bad"" kids.  A quick aside: I watched so many freaking BRILLIANT kids get lost because they weren't able to fit into the meat grinder well enough.  I'm still angry for those boys. Maybe even more so than angry for myself. 
   10. I am paralyzed. What I should do is (first and foremost) turn the damn news off-ugh. Then I should just start with one thing. one thing. I tell myself. ONE thing. and then I'm sitting there playing some stupid solitaire game on my phone-and chain-smoking.  Yeah. I know. I KNOW. 
   11. OH and I haven't eaten in about 15 hours. And I don't feel like cooking because my room is such a freaking mess it's almost impossible to get around. 
   12. AAAAAH! 
   13. I love this page and I love that it's a safe place to be super freaking messy. because I AM A MESS right now.",37
148mz3l,Adhd and roofies,"Hey everyone I was out with friends last night and 

this guy was extremely pushy with me wanting to go have sex. He kept trying to get me to sit next to
Him. I said no and I kept saying no each time he tried to put convo of anything sexual. I wasn‚Äôt interested in that as I don‚Äôt know him either and told him so. When having few drinks I love to
Talk and just social person. I was blunt with him and said to him ‚ÄúI am going to be blunt with you right now, I‚Äôm not having sex with you‚Äù he kinda got up and said he had to use bathroom and I thought he was gonna do the whole bathroom and exit thing which would
Of been ideal, reality i should of done it but after drinking a few drinks. 


I realize now looking back I was very stupid of putting myself in the situation of being there of it all but hindsight is a great thing. 

When he came back to booth from bathroom , he sat next to me ,  which I realize now he has cornered me to the corner of booth.  No exit. He wouldn‚Äôt take no for a answer of being pushy trying to convince me to go home with him and tying to kiss me. He got to kiss me a few seconds before I pulled away and had my hand up. And he tried again and I kept saying no.  I took my phone and messaged my friend to say where I was too and he was even asking who I was texting and I told straight up telling my friend where I am and I was calling a cab.   He still was still trying to convince me to sleep with him, put his hand down back of my pants.    It felt like he was blowing a lot of smoke to convince me to sleep with him to point of gaslighting me saying he knows girls like me that are just a tease.      I still didn‚Äôt budge. It was still a no. 

When he got back from bathroom and he sat next to me , he said I trust you and he took sip of my red bull out of my can.  Cause I even mentioned he doesn‚Äôt know me how does he know if I‚Äôm clean ? Regardless it was odd cause that didn‚Äôt prove the point but having a few drinks I didn‚Äôt think to hard til I got home .   I did stupidly have another sip or two afterwards. I don‚Äôt know if he did put something in the drink as I didn‚Äôt see him so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm thinking to much into it cause when I got back to my friends house -after enforcing to him he is not coming 

I started noticing I was talking excessively.  And fast/pressure speech.  I was going on saying about things that lead to 20 other stories that I eventually branch back to telling the story of what I started with lol. My poor friend I had her tourtured  cause I couldn‚Äôt shut up.   And it was half funny cause I was literally feeling like I was the roadrunner and couldn‚Äôt settle. 

My friend asked but I didn‚Äôt lose any consciousness, no fatigue,  no typical symptoms of roofies so she said it didn‚Äôt happen because of that but I still find i can‚Äôt settle.  I have stopped talking but it‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt. I am just texting people now on my theories of this lol 

Part of me thinking it‚Äôs my anxiety overthinking and over analyzing the situation that even tho he was pushy and wouldn‚Äôt listen to no the entire time I was able to get away when I called the cab.   I wonder if my mind is just making this up lol I know I sound crazy . 

It‚Äôs just that earlier the night he said key words that in one convo  that really  can‚Äôt remember How it came up but I remember it is , that women can accuse men of stuff and it‚Äôs believed , I don‚Äôt think it was the exact same words as that but it was said cause I said while it‚Äôs true and a lot of cases are indeed guilty but also there is a lot of women and men doing shit just in revenge and that I don‚Äôt agree with cause it ruins lives.   (More less men and women are a equal in stuff in accusations depending on circumstances) I didn‚Äôt really pay attention to the rest of convo so I cant say what else was said . 


My question at hand is how do roofies interfere with people who have adhd ? 

 With taking concerta and not taking concerta ? 

It‚Äôs not typical symptoms I have but I wonder if something was put in . 

Thoughts    ??I legit feel crazy for even thinking this. Lol",3
148mt6g,Constantly Double checking that I did things,"So I mentioned this to my friend who has ocd and she said that it sounds like ocd but I really don‚Äôt fit with any other symptom of ocd at all so I was wondering if anyone else does this and if it‚Äôs actually just my adhd.

I constantly double check that I do thighs. Especially repetitive and ‚Äúsecond nature‚Äù tasks‚Äîthings that I do without thinking. This is mainly shown in locking the door and flushing the toilet. I 100% know i did them because I would notice if I didn‚Äôt but because I cannot exactly remember doing it (even if it was seconds later) I have to go back and check that I did. 

With flushing the toilet I literally take a few steps out of the work bathroom and have to walk back in very suspiciously because I genuinely get so anxious at the thought of forgetting. 

Maybe this is just a weird me being forgetful thing but I wanna know does anyone else experience this too?",12
148ms81,Do you ever just put your foot in your mouth,"Like so hard that you may as well have seasoned and roasted it before chowing down?

And it was like a part of me could see myself fucking up in slow motion but the runaway lack of impulse control part just had control over my mouth.


I apologized profusely, and they said they forgive me, but I still can't forgive myself. I'm still spiraling as every other instance of something similar happening flashes through my head. I just want to disappear into the fucking woods on my own where I can never do it again. I'm so tired of masking. I'm sick of doubting every decision I make. I'm exhausted from the constant anxiety.",5
148mrc8,"Being unmedicated and not officially undiagnosed, wondering if getting a diagnosis would make a difference.","Hey! I'm a long-time lurker but this is my first post.

So I've never been officially diagnosed with ADHD, but I have been assessed by two therapists one when I was a child and another a few days ago, who think it's highly likely that I do have ADHD. When my parents were told this after my first assessment, they didn't want to pursue anything because they didn't think it would be useful, and they didn't even tell me that it happened until I started questioning whether I might have ADHD (I was about 14 or so).

Since I begun suspecting that I might have ADHD (this suspicion grew when I learnt about it in class, I'm a psychology major in my junior year of college), I've used techniques to try and make my life a bit less frustrating that have been recommended by my friends who are officially diagnosed, as well as posts that I have read on here. I've also developed my own 'coping skills' as time has gone by.

My question is, do you guys think that being officially diagnosed and/or potentially medicated would make a difference in my life? Since I've managed myself all my life, should I just continue in this way? I have time to make this decision because due to some life circumstances I won't be able to get any of this for a while.

Thanks in advance!",0

148mbpp,ADHD or Anxiety? Not sure.,"Hello all, I have recently switched up my medication from Lexapro to Wellbutrin back in March of this year. Lexapro made my appetite skyrocket and overall made me feel sluggish, with a slight improvement to my anxiety. 

After consulting with my doctor regarding these symptoms, also including a significant gain in weight (food addiction), I switched to Wellbutrin and have been on it ever since.

I am beginning to notice, though, that I find myself going through swings of depression and anxiety, coupled with also needing to occupy myself at all times to avoid boredom. I fall asleep fine even after consuming copious amounts of caffeine during the day. Matter of fact, I always find myself getting more drowsy off a couple cups of coffee. 

Anyways, besides this, I also have better impulse control than when I was on Lex, but still find it a bit hard to focus on conversations and have massive amounts of anxiety when it comes to failure. In my school work I find this the most, using any way possible to avoid mistakes/failing. 

My mind is also constantly racing and I have a hard time not spiraling into either an anxiety rabbit-hole or just thinking way too much and fixating on a meaningless fear/anxiety topic.

Just wanted to know if these are signs of ADHD and if I should pursue further treatment? 

TLDR: recently switched from Lexapro to Wellbutrin, but suspect ADHD symptoms beginning to appear more blatantly?",1

I could explain things, like how the host had a mustache, or even quote some of the gags. but the name of the show wont come to me in the moment for a good long while, and i just sit there, thinking, waiting. like a personified buffer icon.

Today on facetime my friend said something and it was completely muffled, I just couldn't hear or comprehend the words he was saying so he repeated himself.

But isn't that everyone???? Who wants to do work? Who wants to study hard? Wouldn't everyone rather just do something fun? If you're in a boring lecture isn't it natural to just have your mind think about other more exciting things? 

I know I need to get diagnosed professionally but until I can do that I'm just researching more about the symptoms. This is a big one that describes me but I just keep thinking isn't it the same for everyone?? How do I know mine is bad enough that it actually falls into ADHD territory already??? 

What is the threshold? If I can't pay attention no matter how hard I try due to sheer boredom is that considered symptom level already?",10
148l7ru,Is the therapy really helpful treatment or is it just me?,"So I honestly don't see anything useful in therapy. The last time I went, the therapist asked me to try writing a diary. WHERE DOES A DIARY HELP?

148l3q3,what type of stimulating hobbies do you guys enjoy?,"I was just recently diagnosed with ADHD. Not surprised about that but besides the point‚Ä¶ 
I am struggling with crippling depression that I have been numbing my way through basically up until now. I am so god damn tired of being depressed, over reactive and emotional about every little thing. Happy some days but when one small inconvenience happens, I shut down and it‚Äôs very difficult for me to overcome those emotions. However, despite all the chaos I‚Äôve endured, I am truly excited to see where this new journey of mine takes me. I‚Äôm starting medication soon and I am hopeful. :) 

I do draw, I enjoy it, but I‚Äôm wondering what others do to keep their ADHD brains stimulated and well. I read that boredom digs a deeper depression in those with this condition, which then leads to low self esteem. (and baby my self esteem is 3 floors below the underground atm) 

Another hobby of mine is cooking and baking and as much as I enjoy doing it, the mess that I have to deal with after makes me wanna drop to the floor and flop around like a fish on land. I‚Äôm not opposed to doing it more once I‚Äôm medicated and can hopefully deal with the mess.

If you‚Äôve read through all my rambling, thank you - I‚Äôd love to hear your suggestions and also your experiences/words of encouragement! I‚Äôve always known I‚Äôve had this condition, but receiving that diagnosis/validation was a major part of my life that I didn‚Äôt know I needed.",2
148kyes,"Currently on medication.. new doctor/in person, formal assessment tomorrow","New DR adhd testing advice! ü•π

To start, I am a 32 year old woman and I had been diagnosed with adhd in 2010 when I was 19 years old and was prescribed Vyvanse 20mg x2 a day and Wellbutrin. (Can‚Äôt remember exactly what mg, but pretty sure around that) I remember it helping me a lot with being able to live a more fulfilling ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. I was finally able to keep a job, take care of myself, and my apartment, etc I didn‚Äôt ask a lot of questions about my diagnosis at the time. I never fully understood add/adhd back then. I think mostly because I grew up only thinking little boys had it.

I was diagnosed when i lived in Florida. I don‚Äôt even remember my old doctors name and it was back when i was on my parents insurance. I took the medication for about two years and then eventually stopped taking any medication (not sure why, I think I thought I didn‚Äôt need anything at the time)

I moved back to Pennsylvania in 2016, and i have been going to my new psychiatrist since. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety with this doctor and have tried MANY ssri‚Äôs with no help. I recently changed over to Wellbutrin and I have felt so much better‚Ä¶ but not fully.

I began researching more about adhd and was absolutely blown away with how much I related to. I asked my psychiatrist about being treated for it and he referred me to a specialist to do a 3-4 hour long evaluation, since I have never had add medication with my current Dr.

The wait time was MONTHS! So in the meantime, I reached out to an online clinic that specializes with add (not done or cerebral, it‚Äôs an actual clinic) and have been being treated with Vyvanse (and occasionally adderall when it‚Äôs not in stock) and it‚Äôs been SO beneficial to my everyday life and I finally feel like myself again.

I am a bit scared that my new ADHD doctor, that is doing my in person evaluation, will think it‚Äôs weird that I am being treated/already on stim medication. I figured it was fine since I already had a prior diagnosis when I was younger and had previously been on it before. I don‚Äôt want to look like I‚Äôm a drug seeker in anyway

Any advice for how to navigate this? Thanks so much to whomever read all of this!!!!

TLDR: currently on stim prescription that I have previously been on in 2010. New formal diagnoses with new doctor next week, will this be an issue?",1
148ky1y,I forgot to eat.,"Recently started to take Ritalin (10 mg) and it gives me anxiety and my appetite becomes absolute ZERO. I usually eat a packet of biscuits before I take an exam, and then get myself a grilled cheese right after.

When I take my Ritalin, I have an anxiety attack for the whole exam (and longer, I take it at 09:00 and it stops around 15:00, exam ends at 12:00), and afterwards, I don't get hungry enough to get myself my grilled cheese.

Today, I thought, 'eh, I'm not feeling hungry right now, I'll get my food on a different breaktime.' I went to study at 12:45, got distracted by my phone and finally raised my head at 15:30 when a teacher came. I had questions to ask her, so I was doing that, but during that, I thought..

""Why do I have a headache and feel nauseous right now?""

I thought about it for a bit, then realized..
Oh. *OH.* I didn't eat breakfast! I stayed from 09:00 to 17:00 with only a packet of biscuits. And, I hadn't even finished a bottle of 0.5 L water. And I'm wondering *why* I'm nauseous and have a headache!

I've forgotten to eat before when I was hyperfocused on something, but I usually had someone around to remind me and I would actually eat at a reasonable time thanks to them. Today, I was completely alone, and probably wouldn't have realized until I got home (6 PM) that I hadn't eaten the whole day.

Several years go by and the symptoms got worse. I was a little more than just ""hyper"". I was forgetful, I had trouble focusing, and no motivation at all. Don't even get me started on resting. Even the simplest tasked seemed difficult. 

After a while I had decided to get a profesional diagnosis. And sure enough, I had adhd.

I spoke with a therapist and she is having me meet up with a psychiatrist to talk and so I could get recommended some medication.

Now this is where I start to feel alone. My parents and the rest of my family don't want me to take medication. 

They tell me things like ""it won't work"" ""its in my head"" ""im going to become addicted"" and so on. My sisters have even made fun of me for having adhd. And now my mom is telling me I don't have adhd.

I have no one to support me through this. Everyone keeps telling me whats best for me. No one else has adhd so they don't know what it feels like.

I'm still going to take the medication. I want to fet better. Even if I have to do it alone.

1482nry,"Walgreens suddenly dropped me, I'm freaking out, how do I find another pharmacy with Teva?","Well it's finally my turn, I guess. For the past 2 years, my local Walgreens (literally next to my house) has been happily filling my Adderall IR prescription, plus they've almost always had it in stock. I am on Medicaid, but Walgreens won't honor Medicaid insurance, so I have to pay $30 out of pocket. This is worth it to me, since the Aurobindo/North Star pills I got the first time made me sick (heartburn, burping, acid-reflux feeling, gas, etc). When I googled that back then, lots of results came up for that crappy brand causing similar side effects for other people. Everyone said Teva was best, and my Walgreens had it, so all was well. Needless to say, the Teva pills have absolutely no side effects for me.

My doctor sends three 1-month prescriptions to the pharmacy (90-day supply) to be dispensed monthly. Last month when I went to pickup, it was 96 days, and the last prescription got marked as expired in their system. It took 20 minutes for them to sort it out, then the pharmacist came over and told me ""I'll fill this as a courtesy since this is the last of the 3 prescriptions your doctor sent, but from now on this pharmacy will no longer fill this medication for you."" I was aghast and completely blind-sided. My vision was spinning and my heart pounding. I kept my composure and politely asked ""Why?"" and she said ""Because the computer says you have Medicaid, yet you are paying cash, and that is very suspicious. You are too high of a risk, Walgreens only dispenses scheduled medications to customers who pay with insurance."" I politely told her ""But you've been filling it for almost 2 years and I've always paid cash and that's never been a problem...?"" and she said ""I know, that's why I'm still giving you this."" I didn't want to press it further, and her accent was so heavy I could only understand every third word.

I've never done ANYTHING suspicious, I'm not a shady character (I'm well-dressed, clean, etc), I ALWAYS pay with a credit card (not anonymous cash), I live on the same street (not in some far-away town), I've been on the same dosage for 2 years, never any demands to pickup early, my doctor is well-regarded and has practiced for over 30 years, etc. I can't see any reason they would consider me high-risk besides the fact that I have to pay out of pocket.

I have no idea what to do now. My med renewal appointment with my doctor is tomorrow afternoon. I had a month to figure this out, so naturally I'm asking for advice the night before...

What should I do? Is this new Walgreens policy ""real""? Is the pharmacist crazy? How do I explain this to my doctor without him thinking I'm some sort of criminal who got dropped by the pharmacy for some nefarious reason?

Needless to say I'm having a panic attack. I've been able to cope thus far because I've just ignored it, but now the month flew by and I have no time left.

If it matters, I'm in New Jersey.

My options:

1. Let my doctor send it over as normal. See what happens. I have nothing to hide, and I'm not even clear on why everything was fine for 2 years and suddenly it isn't. Then worst case, since nothing was dispensed, have the doctor send it elsewhere.
2. Tell my doctor to send it to a different local Walgreens. Obviously moot if this is a real corporate policy change though.
3. Explain this to my doctor, who likely won't be rattled, but he will certainly ask ""ok so what pharmacy do you want me to send this to?"" and since I have no idea what brands are carried by other pharmacies around here, I have no idea what to say.
4. Should I call around? How can I ask what brand they have? ""Hello, beautiful day we're having, I was wondering what brand generic Adderall you sell?"" Isn't that pretty suspicious? What if I phrase it differently, like ""Hello, my pharmacy has been having difficulty filling my prescription for Adderall, are you able to stock it reliably, and what brand generic would that be?""

As always for us, the worst part is that I/we didn't do anything wrong to deserve all this. :(

I was hoping it would help my focus and motivation because, like so many posts I‚Äôve read on here, I was bored, unmotivated, burned out, and it felt like I hit a wall any time I tried to start or finish a task at work (especially those long, drawn out projects that have no end in sight and no real deadlines for that last minute boost from anxiety to help push you over the finish line). Among a slew of other symptoms. Honestly, as a side note, it‚Äôs simultaneously frustrating to know that I‚Äôve gone this long not knowing why I am the way I am and that there is a reason why, but also really encouraging that there are so many others out there like me. 

And then my job was impacted during the latest round of layoffs at my company on Friday. 

So now I also just lost my routine. Given that being easily bored and unmotivated and having a difficult time doing things was already a huge struggle, I‚Äôm not sure how to keep myself from melting into a puddle on the couch all day.

148kerh,"People with ADHD, do these examples sound familiar?","  
Hello :) So my whole life I felt like I have big hopes and dreams, but somehow ""stuck"".   
It was only recently that I found out that I may have ADHD, which was quite shocking but an ""A-ha experience"".   
I am currently seeing a psychologist to find out if I have ADHD. I mostly suspect ADD, but after reading a bit I think I may have the full spectrum of ADHD, just a slightly lesser degree of hyperactivity. so I want to ask those of you who have ADHD are familiar with the examples I list below. So here are some few examples:

  
In my first appointment with the psychologist, I arrived a month early. The next session I forgot the day.   
I struggle to remember birthdays, or dates. I don't know my mother or two of my sisters. Just my twin sister :) And i remember my dads. But that's because I have used his bike with his bikelock that has his birthday. A friend I knew for 7 years said she was dissapointed to me yesterday because I didn't remember :(   
I met my ex at the gym. I asked her if she had bought herself a new training shirt. (I bought it for her as a present).  
I almost missed my flight because when I read instructions I can read completely wrong or just overlook. I had also turned up at the airport one day and saw that I had booked a ticket a month in advance.  
I have never read a book. Can read sentences over and over again. Unable to stay focused.   
Daydreaming a lot.  
Want to get a lot out of life, but feel stuck.  
Constant dialogue in my head with myself.  
Struggling with numbness and meaninglessness.  
Can start projects but struggle to complete them.  
Mess things up constantly. In the last week alone, I've lost my house key twice. Found them in the cutlery drawer and the wardrobe.  
Always tinkering with something  
I get uneasiness in my body if I sit still

  
So that's just few examples. The list continues. So to the people with ADHD experience, do this sound familiar?",6
14825r2,Chemo medications my mom took apparently exacerbated my adhd,"Has anyone ever been told...

...that their ADHD more than likely stems largely from medications their mother took while they were in-utero?  (And other environmental things)

EDIT: This is a long post, so I won't be offended if you don't make it all the way through.  It's been  therapeutic for me to write it, though. I think I needed to give voice to this for quite awhile.  

My diagnosing psychiatrist read my entire family health history and asked me if there was any way I could get my hands on a list of the chemo meds my mom was on  before she realized she was pregnant with me. 

My parents kept everything, so there was a list. That was a very difficult list to get, since my mother died from breast cancer when I was two, apparently for not being able to take chemo during my gestation. (More on that later, maybe.)My father blamed me for her death, since she'd been given the option to abort. Both my father and my stepmother were in deep denial over my mental health issues.  I had to ask my psychiatrist for his notes before they would even consider giving me the list of meds. 

Anyway, he went over the list and told me that my adhd was more than likely grossly  exacerbated by those meds crossing the placenta for my first 4 months in-utero. That was 1960, and they didn't know much more than that my mom couldn't take her chemobwhile pregnant so, 4 months along with me, she stopped treatment.  

That was whammy number 1. Whammy number 2 was him telling me that the physical and emotional abuse I received on a daily basis also affected my brain and could be another reason why my adhd was so bad. Whammy number 3 was him telling me that my then 4 year old son needed to be seen to be monitored for adhd. 

I was diagnosed 30 years ago,  and his comments were pretty radical for the early 90s. I got lucky, because he was a neurosurgeon as well as a neuropsychiatrist and his psychiatric specialty was adult adhd, which was almost unheard of then. 

Doc P was adhd himself, and so were 2 of his kids. He put a lot of research time into the condition. 

I was that child who was labeled lazy, willfully disobedient, scatterbrained, and stupid. (Even with a significantly higher than average IQ) 

My grades didn't meet with my parent's approval from 7th through 12th grade. My grade school report cards always said I  was ""very bright, but talks too much, doesn't pay attention, and wouldn't stay in her assigned seat."" 

So regardless my grades in grade school, I was beaten daily by both parents in an effort to ""teach"" me to ""behave.""

I spent all of my junior high and high school years grounded because I always got Cs or lower in math. My other grades were As and Bs but just one C got me grounded, belittled, screamed at, and beaten up for entire semesters at a time.
I didn't develop decent social interaction skills until much later. 

I was constantly told I'd never amount to anything and it was a ""damned good thing"" that I was ""the pretty one"" because there was no other way I'd get a husband. Yep. Welcome to my childhood.  

On and on, ad nauseum. Wash, rinse, repeat. 

My father used to like to sneak up behind me while I was studying and whack me in the back of the head with his college ring. I usually saw stars. I'm pretty sure that didn't do my brain any favors. 

My stepmother used to yank  me around the house by my hair screaming at me for things like pulling the portable dishwasher out ""wrong,"" or not walking with my shoulders back, or not smiling enough. She once pushed me down the basement stairs for the not smiling infraction.  She was an alcoholic.  Dad was a dry drunk. They're both gone now, but it wasn't the relief I thought it would be. Maybe more on that later.  

Anyway, I m relating all this because it played a huge part in my doctor's diagnosis of ADHD, CPTSD, clinical depression, and general anxiety disorder. 

Again, I was so fortunate to have this doctor. He immediately recognized what was ""wrong"" with me. He probably saved my life, since he got me properly  medicated within that first 6 months of treatment.  

Oh yeah, my sister has the same diagnosis. My brother refuses to seek help but I'm pretty sure he would get the same dx. He self medicates with alcohol and pot. 

My doc told me that it was his opinion that adhd is an inherited disorder (that was radical back then) and in my case it was made much worse by my parent's mistreatment of me. I have cousins on my birth  mother's side who have an ADHD diagnosis as well.  

My son is also adhd but without the ptsd portion. He suffers from generalized anxiety disorder as well as depression. Growing up, he refused to take his adhd meds. Since he lived with his father except on weekends(I didn't believe i could be a good enough parent. I was wrong) I wasnt aware that his dad wasn't doing everything possible to explain to him why he needed to take his meds. 

He's 34 this year and finally got sick of the rollercoaster and sought treatment. He's taking his meds now and recently told me that the reason he didn't take his meds is because his father never told him what they were for. I don't know why he didn't ask me, and he can't explain it either. 

He is also on Adderall and it has changed his life. He's going through some adjustment anger at his father for not telling him about his adhd. He's right to be angry. By extension, he's also angry with me because I didn't think to tell him. I didn't.  I assumed his father had it under control. Stupid me. 

So he's not speaking to either of us right now, but I know him well. He'll work through it and call in a few months.

Interviews are nerve wracking with one person, let alone a PANEL of 3! The position was admin within a community emergency services org. It was 45 minutes long, with 6 scored questions and 4 unscored.

Today I got the call saying I didn‚Äôt get the position, which was of course upsetting.. but it was the feedback I received that has got me reeling. 
They gave me two compliments, then rattled off a list of 6+  things that I need to improve on‚Ä¶ all of them basically boiling down to ADHD symptoms or difficulties‚Ä¶ it felt like a kick in the guts.

(I often left them on the stove after washing, that's where they're used right?) If dishes are not right above the dishwasher I will be unmotivated. I got a pretty spice rack for my meds and vitamins but she took them out and used it for spices...haven't taken any of my supplements all week. She put my prescriptions easily accessible to be helpful but that's only half of it. 

Not sure how to help her understand. She also struggles with keeping things clean and will go days without doing dishes. I was hoping I could help her in this area.  With my former system I was doing dishes nightly. Now I just feel overwhelmed. 

I think she's looking for the home to be visually calming and such. I get it, but most of the house organization tips she has shot down based on not looking good when they actually helped me to keep the house free from clutter, vaccuumed, dishes done, etc. My pegboards and wall grids maybe are clutter to her? But having everything within reach and easy to put away means I'm functional.",1

148k280,Vyvanse mid day crash,"I am 24F currently prescribed 30 mg of Vyvanse, and have been prescribed since I was 16. I started on 20 mg, then my dosage was boosted to 40 mg after a year or two. After excessive weight loss & a change of pace in life (took a gap year between high school and college) I took a break from ADHD meds to regain weight. Upon starting college, I went back on, and have been taking 30 mg since I was 19, and they have stayed pretty consistent in functioning well for me since.

Problem is, I just started my 8-5 corporate job, and I am experiencing pretty harsh crash midday. I take my meds at 5:00 am, which I know is excessively early. An issue I‚Äôve run into after being on Vyvanse so long is I will literally sleep through all my morning alarms if the drug isn‚Äôt in my system. I have grown physically dependent on it & will sleep into noon or so if I don‚Äôt take it an 60-90 min before my desired time of actually waking up. This method got me through college & part time work, but now starting my career is beginning to cause issues, because all my productivity is lost around noon - 1:00 pm. 

I don‚Äôt really want to increase my dosage, because I‚Äôm afraid of the dramatic weight loss I‚Äôve experienced on a higher dose, and before this circumstance, all was pretty much going great.

However, knowing that I have ADHD and slow cognitive processing speed(I scored in the bottom 10% last time I tested that) I have been wondering if the reason for the plateau in my ability to understand the languages effectively when hearing them spoken is not because I have not studied them extensively enough but that it is my processing speed preventing me no matter how well I know them? 

I would like to believe that I still have the ability to effectively pursue this passion, but at the same time I don't want to devote myself to something and advertise it if anyone who spends half the time as me studying will talk circles around me and make me look pathetic. I am sick of losing to people in things and if this is going to be another losing battle then I'd rather find something else to get good at.",1

148ijvr,Vyvanse and caffeine,"Hello everyone!

This isn't rocket science, but it still bears mention I think:

If you were managing your ADHD with caffeine (especially if you have a later in life diagnosis) and are starting a stimulant medication like Vyvanse, you might benefit from making a plan to slow or stop the caffeine intake.

I was drinking like 4-8 cups of coffee a day for years and years, so when I started medication it was rough. It still is! I could either oblige the caffeine addiction and get anxious as all hell as a result of mixing the two, or I could be sluggish and grouchy from caffeine withdrawal. At least when the medication is still active, the two don't get along well for me so the goal is to limit caffeine as much as possible.

Right now I'm down to a few cups of tea a day and I feel so much better. It was something I should have anticipated but for some reason I didn't. Here's hoping it saves someone else some struggle",7

148icdl,Freak outs,"So sometimes i have moments where I get very overally emotional (extremely angry, extremely depressed, extremely happy) and my reaction is disproportionate to whatever happened.

I feel like such a shitty person after this happens as sometimes I get irrationally angry or anxious towards a person and often it hurts there feelings even when I don‚Äôt want to. I have had outbursts like this since I was younger and I also have many other common symptoms of adhd. But I was wondering if emotional outbursts could be ADHD related? 



Edit: I don‚Äôt know if this means anything but most of family has been diagnosed adhd and in general our family has genetic mental health problems such as depression anxiety etc.",1
148ibpu,My confusion about ADHD .,"I am currently 15. I have not been diagnosed with ADHD yet, but I am highly suspicious about me having it. I  show quite a bit of symptoms on the inattentive side of ADHD like forgetfulness, inorganization, saying things out loud without giving much thought, misplace stuff, . I kinda also have some unsure symptoms like inattentiveness (sometimes I do kinda skip time during a class I am not interested in like Malay with a few questions, sometimes when I was called to do something like picking up something but when I got to that place I was thinking about something else and just do whatever I wanted in that room until my someone reminded me or something I saw or happen reminds me. I also somewhat didn't really listen to the teacher attentively and make mistakes such as thought something that doesn't need to be brought I brought it and the opposite of that etc. ) , easily being distracted (while writing this I heard an outro song of a Korean show and when I came back to look at my PC and write this I immediately forgot what was I going to write again so maybe that counts?) , while reading novels/articles/essays I accidentally reread or skip a line, clustered thoughts.(I'm the most unsure on this one, second is the inattentiveness part. I really question myself if I do actually think a lot of stuff at once. My brain just jumps from an image about an topic to another topic constantly which I'm still not sure if I'm even doing it on purpose. Hell I don't even know what the fuck am I saying.) I also think I may have Hyperfocus but I don't really know how that feels. I heard that when hyperfocusing you just don't even hear sounds which I clearly do, prob just mostly ignoring them unless it's someone calling to me or just a large shift in the atmosphere and sounds then I come out of something I focus. I kinda wanna know.   


I wanted to ask about this since I really want a approval if I should go see a psychiatrist about this. They are really not cheap and I'm really unsure if I want to do it as my symptoms don't seem too ADHD-like. I just don't really want to put a burden on my family for something I don't have. Sometimes I just feel like it's something not that bad so I don't really need to address so I just don't mention it. It's been giving me stress and my mother being reluctant makes me worry even more when she gives in. I've been really sad when I got rejected by an request I made so that's really why I'm just afraid to confess to crushes over the years. I also don't like annoying or hurting anyone so I'm just really afraid of interacting with many people. I just really don't know how to deal with being scolded, shouted at, told I'm no use etc.  


My ADHD suspicions also kinda came from gaming habits such as having a phone out playing a long form Youtube video while playing Terraria when it doesn't require a lot of my attention. (Kinda also do this with Ultrakill but that game just takes all my attention so it just doesn't work and may hinder my performance a lot.) I also take multiplayer games way too seriously sometimes when I tell myself I want to be more casual. Like when I'm playing Phantom Forces I keep telling myself not worry about dying and not watch my KDR. And then I keep getting killed when I walk for like 20 seconds and pull out my bad KDR and start having really toxic thoughts and expressions.   


Overall I don't want to do a self-diagnosis and want suggestions if I should go to a psychiatrist for a diagnosis and get help. I also think I forgot some symptoms as well so if you don't find a symptom that commonly ADHD people have in my symptoms list, uh that's why and maybe point that out.   


Also I've been putting off my History homework while writing this so that counts as sidetracking? I do this quite a lot ngl.  And I've accidentally been writing this for an hour now.  


Oh and also I'm confused if ADHD people only think virtually since I do have words in my head while having images. Never gotten out a full ass inner-conversation though. Maybe.

148hf0j,Lovely bodily feeling on methylphenidate - what's causing this?,"I'm currently in titration for ADHD medication in the UK, with Psychiatry UK (many years later than I should have started, but we move!), and am struggling to decide which of methylphenidate and lisdexamphetamine would work better for me in the long-term. Both have significant strengths and some weaknesses (strengths far outweigh weaknesses with both), however one particular strength of methylphenidate is something I couldn't have predicted, and doesn't seem to be something that I can find any trace of anyone else experiencing, nor can I find anything describing anything like this in any of the literature.

When I take methylphenidate, I get a wonderful bodily feeling, particularly in the morning. It's really hard to describe this feeling but I'll try by way of a couple of analogies. It feels like every cell in large swathes of my body, particularly my legs, is being massaged by something soft and comforting. Like a pervasive sense of relaxation and mellowness across a lot of my body. 

I want this thread to focus on the phenomenon I'm describing itself and not so much on myself, but here's a very brief profile in case that helps contextualise this: I have bipolar II, ASD and dyspraxia; methylphenidate gives me an amazing feeling of focus, some euphoria which is wonderful but also some anxiety, and is causing quite a bit of vasoconstriction; lisdex has been giving me a steady but much less impressive level of focus, and almost no euphoria/anxiety (or this bodily feeling), and little to no noticeable vasoconstriction. 

&#x200B;

* Is there a name for this particular phenomenon?
* What is causing it?
* Is this feeling at all likely to be causally linked with the other side-effects of methylphenidate (for example, is it likely that the euphoria and/or anxiety share a common cause with this bodily feeling)?
* Are there any particular risks associated with occurrence of this feeling?",1

148h887,Vyvanse not working for me anymore. Any success stories with nonstimulants?,"*sorry for a long post*

(26 F, currently on Vyvanse 70mg) I got diagnosed with inattentive ADHD in January 2022. After having unsuccessful run with Medikinet and Concerta, I started Vyvanse on which I finally felt like a functional being. I felt motivated, my head was ‚Äúsilent‚Äù, I had no problem focusing on tasks and overall felt like the medication helped me with anxiety and gave me a little extra time to process emotions and not to act impulsive. 
It was a life changing experience, as my whole life I struggled with keeping jobs, finishing tasks, forming habits, relations, dumb mistakes, forgetfulness and being emotional‚Ä¶

Unfortunately, by the end 2022, I started to feel as if the medicine stopped working.(Not from day to day, but progressively) My ADHD symptoms were all back. I started to feel foggy, easily irritated and very anxious. Many days I questioned if I even took my dose, as it felt like I didn‚Äôt. I tried lowering my dose, since I had leftovers of 50mg, but I didn‚Äôt feel the lower dose at all or any improvement. 

It feels like all the positive effects stopped and my productivity is now driven only by anxiety, which has become more and more unbearable. I feel exhausted, irritated, nothing excites me and I feel either numb or anxious. At this point I worry that I‚Äôm becoming depressed, because I feel very hopeless as well.

I went to my psychiatrist this January, saying that my meds are not working anymore and that I probably developed tolerance. She told me, that it is impossible to have tolerance on Vyvanse and that my meds are probably not working because of burnout/stress. I got recommended combination of Vyvanse with Strattera and sent for EKG and blood pressure measurement before getting the prescription. 

This took me on 6 months long detour, as the nurse measured too high of a blood pressure. I was under tight observation for the last months (and a lot more stress, since my doc was ready to stop my current/future treatment with medication for good). Turns out that I have white cloak syndrome and my blood pressure is otherwise fine‚Ä¶ Glad to get that settled at least‚Ä¶

I have now soon appointment with my doc again. Nothing has gotten better since January, quite the contrary and I feel like I need to take some action. I haven‚Äôt had the best or the most stable experiences with stimulants so far and stability is the thing I crave the most. I am also still quite sure that I developed tolerance to Vyvanse and therefore fear of developing tolerance to any other prescribed stimulant. I am ready to switch from Vyvanse, but I fear if can find anything that can make me function as good as Vyvanse did (before it all stopped). 

Is there anybody that has a success story with non stimulants? Does it have a stable effect over a long period of time (years)? And is the strength of the effect somehow comparable to stimulants?

I get distracted without even realizing I'm getting distracted. And I don't mean the stereotypical ‚Äòlook a bird'-kind of distracted ü™üüê¶üëÄ, **but distracted _within_ the thing I'm doing**.

That's why it's so sneaky. I'II be working on an article (about ie fungi growing on public spaces) and only after returning from a small break or getting a coffee, l'lI see my screen filled with articles about space engineering and realize that that's actually not related to or 'along the lines' of my topic at all. (Bonus adhd-points for whoever gets it, though)

&nbsp;

But the whole time I'm actually focused and writing, I won't notice this at all. Same with trying to write an email, just the act of opening my inbox and seeing four other things that stress me out will make me do those first (or attempt to, before being distracted again)

&nbsp;

Literally the act of writing this is part of the problem. I was just doing - something (?) important (?) and I left it to write this instead. I'll probably forget about it until someone reminds me and by then it will be too late and everything will be awful.

&nbsp;

How do other adhd-people manage this? How do you fix subconscious behavior / behavior you're only aware of afterwards?",2
148gxmo,Does it sometimes feel as though yourself or others simply can‚Äôt move ‚Äúfast‚Äù enough?,"I‚Äôve been working towards getting a screening done and the more and more I‚Äôm reading about the less common ADHD symptoms and behaviors the more things start to click into place with how I think and act. 

One weird thing that happens a lot that I‚Äôm trying to figure out if it‚Äôs an ADHD symptom or just a me thing is that occasionally I feel like when I‚Äôm doing (or trying) to do certain tasks I literally can not move as fast as I want/am thinking. 

For example, at work I tend to have to do some repetitive tasks with opening/editing PDFs and I‚Äôve gotten incredibly efficient with it using keyboard short cuts. I often find that the bottleneck in me being able to do them is actually the file saving itself before I can move on. 

Another much more mundane example is sometimes when I‚Äôm in the kitchen with my wife and we‚Äôre cooking I get annoyed because she somehow can‚Äôt magically read my mind and know that I‚Äôm trying to coordinate cooking/cleaning/grabbing things out of the cabinets or fridges in some super weird efficient order. This same exact thing plays out when I‚Äôm doing simple stuff like grocery shopping or driving 


Anytime these situations come up I feel myself get weirdly anxious for no reason and my internal monologue is just screaming ‚ÄúMOVE‚Äù and getting really really annoyed that no one else seems to have the same energy about it. 

Just trying to figure out if this is some symptom of ADHD that might be brought down a bit with some meds or if it‚Äôs just a me thing that I‚Äôm going to have to deal with/get some therapy on.",4
148gv3u,My adderall isnt as effective anymore,"I started taking it again after 11 months because i was pregnant.

My brain feels stimulated.

148gryg,Difficulty dealing with partner who has ADHD,"My partner has gotten diagnosed with adult ADHD a couple of months back. As you can imagine it's been a huge relief to finaly understand herself better. It's become a huge part of both our lives. It's become a daily topic.

I'm giving her as much space and time as she needs to explore this. I'm changing my behavior, and I'm trying to empathise and listen without judging as much as possible.   
The problem: she can be quite judgemental towards me. 

  
If I (gently) try to push back she'll use her ADHD as a ""shield"" to deflect any personal responsibility:  
If I'm in the wrong, it's a personal defect and I should change it; If she's in the wrong, it's related to her ADHD and can't be changed, I should change my feelings towards it. We're not so much having two-way conversations as just mentioning what I'm doing wrong lol   


It's not just in our conversation where I see this kind of shielding behavior. I've seen her become stubborn at certain points due to her ADHD. She has started to write off job opportunities, (new) experiences, friends, activities - even her therapist's treatment suggestions. This stubbornness leads to certain paralysis, which leads to extra stress.   
Doing it is stressful, not doing it and not moving forward is equally if not more stressful. On the one hand she has no clue what to do and is looking for guidance, but when receiving advice she most of the times won't even consider it to be valid if it doesn't feel right - almost never fully explaining what doesn't feel right.   


I'm completely in the dark here. Pretty much I'm asking it here to see if you can recognize this behavior, did you ever have such a conversation with your partner, family or friends. Should I even bring this behavior of shielding behind the diagnosis up or not?

148gqgj,Medication side effects with every medication,"Hi all,

I've been trying to find the right medication since I was diagnosed last July/August. So far every medication has given me side effects right away or they develop after prolonged use of my medication. Im starting to feel like I won't ever find the right medication for me and its scary because I'm in grad school. If I can't figure this out I don't think I'll pass and its because of focus because I know I understand the material. I'm at the point where i find myself saying ""I just wish I was normal"" which is a mindset I've tried hard to avoid.

Currently Im on Wellbutrin 150 XL and I have nightly nightmares that wake me up after only 2 hours of sleep

Adderall: Worked amazing I've never retained info as well as I did but I developed anxiety attacks and depressive thoughts after a month of only 20mg daily

Ritalin: Extreme nausea, unable to eat, rebound headaches

Guanfacine and Straterra: Extremely exhausted to the point I wasn't productive and very lightheaded + nauseous",5
148gp9e,ADHD tax: spending money on groceries and then buying lunch/dinner,"This has been a pattern with me. On a good ADHD day, I go out and buy groceries to cook my meals for the week. If my week goes okay, I manage to cook most of the meals. But recently, my ADHD has been so bad that I buy lunch at work (and order takeout for dinner or skip it). I end up throwing out the produce or anything that went bad after 10 days. The cycle repeats because I forget on the good day how bad it is when its not going well. 

I feel guilty for doing this. I enjoy cooking and hate spending money unnecessarily.

148gnbq,I forgot I lost my AHS card back in January and only remembered before the walk-in by my house opened,"***I'm not seeking advice or empathy. I'm just venting about my own incompetence***

TLDR; I lost my health card months ago and have had plenty of opportunities to replace it but kept forgetting. Now that I need it ASAP I have put myself in an awkward predicament with an injury I got. It's not an emergency but it's not something I can manage without a doctor at this point either. Without a card, I can't go to the hospital either. I've just screwed myself üôÉ



For Christmas I (30F) got a new purse and wallet. I immediately switched everything over. I know for sure during some time in January I had my Alberta Health card in the new wallet because I needed to enter that information on a form. That was the last time I saw it. I don't remember taking it out or tucking it away. It's always been one of those things that I have luckily only managed to lose once before when I was around 18. 

I should have ordered a new one right away but completely forgot. I have a doctor I see regularly and they already have all my information. Same with my pharmacy. Though, I would need it for emergencies such as going to the hospital. Luckily I haven't been put in that position. 

About 2 months ago I received a new bedframe. I already have a desk no one will help me build, but the frame seemed simple enough to do on my own. I got so far into the process when I realized I absolutely need someone to just hold the end of the frame. At this moment I was trying to slide the side rails onto their little hook things. Just as I saw that I couldn't get any further, the side rail slipped from my hand and landed on the nail of my big toe. It immediately turned purple and swelled up. 

Everyone told me then to go and see a doctor. I am horrified about nail stuff and from what I was reading, the doctor would just take the nail off before it got a chance to get infected. This horrified me. I couldn't think of any way I could deal with it that didn't involve them sedating me/knocking me out in some way. Because I am medicated for my ADHD I got worried that would contribute to them thinking I had drug seeking behaviour and I just got too anxious to go.

My regular doctor only works at that clinic on Tuesdays and Fridays. I normally just see her about my medication and mental health and whatever very basic check ups I need to do largely because the schedule doesn't work for me when it comes to other stuff. But I did see her about a month ago for my medication and for some reason thought better of it. I'm not sure if it was the anxiety about having someone touch my toe or what. To be honest though, the toe was doing fine at that point. Just very black. The new nail was starting to grow in and with how things were going, I just ultimately thought I got lucky with the healing process not being as gross as I feared.

Just over a week ago now, I was rolling over in bed and my right toe bumped my left leg ever so gently. Normally I think it would have been something a person wouldn't even notice happened. The only reason I know is because it made a very loud crunch. When I checked it most of the nail was now detached. There is a part on the left side of it that's fully healthy and fine. I've been keeping it as clean as I can but also wrapped in bandages. Though it has bleed randomly and has leaked some weird yellowish stuff. I went to the pharmacy and they recommended I get it looked at. But because I couldn't even ask the questions I wanted without feeling light headed and anxious, I tried to deal with it on my own still. Which led to my getting drunk af and trying to just rip the rest of the nail off. This didn't happen. I couldn't even lift the one side to put the polysporin under it. I ended up being so hungover at work the next day, one of our delivery drivers had to take me home. It was embarrassing and awful and pointless.

Today at 1:35pm I get my braces off. I have been wearing them for 2 years now and I'm super excited to be done my treatment. Though, I know that I'm going to have to deal with them sanding the glue off and just all sorts of gross things. I took the morning off work so I could go to the walk-in by my house. My theory was that the toe will be significantly worse to deal with but because I'll have to deal with mouth pain later, perhaps I wouldn't think about the toe so much. I should have called my doctor because her office is right beside my orthodontist. But because it was later in the week when I would have been making the appointment, I just assumed she wouldn't have the time to see me today. I totally forgot about the health care card thing until just before 7am this morning. 

I panicked and searched some of the places it could be. Like I said, I last saw it in my wallet in January. I did find a referral form that has my number on it. I'm hoping that will work for the walk-in but what I was reading on the AHS website I could still be charged for the service without my physical card. I'm so incredibly annoyed with myself because I'm now stuck in this awkward position of taking a chance to see someone and paying out of pocket. Which I have no clue how that works at all or how much it will be. I know if you don't have insurance or some sort of coverage an ambulance ride can cost $500. The AHS is going through some less than good changes because Alberta is run by absolute chuckle heads trying to privatize everything, so chances of being charged are higher. Though, it's still my fault for not ordering a new one back when I first noticed it was gone. I'm so frustrated and annoyed with myself right now. 

The only information that the card has, is my AHS #, full legal name, DOB, and whether or not if I'm an organ donor. I have photo id with my current address and my birth certificate. I'm hoping maybe this will help alongside the referral form for all the information they would need anyways.",2

148g73g,Calling all PhDs/PhD candidates - how did you survive?,"I'm applying for a PhD program that I'm really excited about - and really nervous about. I think I'm a very strong candidate for admission; the reasons why aren't important to this post, but I want to emphasize that this question is less about the application process, and more about preparing for the life of being a doctoral student in general.

It's been a little under a a decade since I left undergrad, and I was completely burnt out by the time I walked the stage. At the time, I was not diagnosed with ADHD and (obviously) was not medicated. It's really exciting to think about going back to school now that I *am* medicated and know how to support the way my brain works. I can imagine very easily that there will be things about being a doctoral student that work very well for my ADHD (research/curiosity-based work, social and collaborative work, non-traditional schedules). But I'm certain there are things that will be extra hard, and I probably haven't considered them in full yet because I'm so excited by the positives.

So... come rain on my parade! Just a little :) I would really love to hear from folks who are either currently doing or recently finished a PhD program and what kind of additional support they needed for their ADHD. Do you have accomodations through the university disability office? Do your professors/colleagues know your diagnosis? What challenges surprised you and how did you deal with them? Is there anything you wish you had done or prepared before you started?

148ej2t,ADHD Diagnosis: M/31/India,"Dear Community Members,

I am a 31 year old man living in New Delhi, India. I have been experiencing  symptoms for too long for me to ignore now. Simple things feel like mammoth tasks to me; I need to break down the simplest of things to reorient myself, motivate myself, and keep organized. I have a history of depression, and anxiety too. After a lot of deliberation, I recently saw a psychiatrist for diagnosis. Given my history, he suggested that I undergo a thorough evaluation with  a psychologist to rule out possible options, and have clarity in diagnosis. I underwent this proposed evaluation with a therapist recommended by him. The evaluation consisted of a range of questionnaires, standardized tests, and a bit of getting to understand my history. One of the components was a questionnaire was for something called a The Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS‚Ñ¢)- which evaluated my live-in partner's responses to about 60 questions. The final evaluation concluded that I do not have ADHD, but the therapist also mentioned at this point that the ADHD diagnosis was completely based on my partner's responses, and the other tests taken by me were for evaluating things other than ADHD. My partner is a rather happy-go-lucky guy, who often struggles to understand what I am going through. When I had seen his responses to the questionnaire filled by him, I had told him, as well as my therapist about how his responses are in no way reflection of how I feel about my lived reality. The therapists' report further suggested that I have high levels of anxiety, and possible depression, for which, I may seek treatment. I have known about my anxiety, and recognize that it is something that will be a recurring theme in my life, and can only be managed, and not ""fixed"" as such.

&#x200B;

Here's my issue: In my understanding, there exists significant dissonance between how one perceives their symptoms and lived experiences, vis-√†-vis how others, even life partners, may view  those experiences. I do not go about breaking down my experiences and sharing them with others. The fact that I am consistently trying to cope with tasks does not do away with the fact that I find them extremely tedious and have to consistently push myself to do them. I spoke to both my psychiatrist, and psychologist about this- and they simply suggested that this is how the test is designed. My psychiatrist said that he cannot prescribe me any medication or treatment for ADHD (understandably so), but has recommended that I start taking anti-depressants. I feel almost heartbroken having gone through this process (given that the more I read about ADHD, the more I relate to it- No, it's no confirmation bias). I am so tired of having to explain myself to everyone, and what I go through on a day-to-day basis, and a bit lost at this moment as to what do I do. Should I see another psychiatrist and go through another round of evaluation (which will be expensive, but I can afford it), or should I give the anti-depressants a chance? Please advise.

Love,

148eig6,I can't work on my reports on MBA,"I'm an international MBA student in Australia, almost 30 years old. I got diagnosed for ADHD only last year. Only got to know about ADHD after searching for my issue with procrastination. I always knew I had struggles controlling my extreme emotions, and for all other issues, I used to blame myself. I was able to finish my bachelor's thesis within the last 4 days before the deadline back in 2019. But it was not up to my expectations and I really blamed myself on it since I wholeheartedly wanted to give it my best. Nevertheless I was able to complete it somehow.

During the COVID pandemic with working from home my situation got really bad. I was diagnosed for anxiety even though I kept saying to the doctor that my initial issue is not settled even though I'm feeling a little alright. The misdiagnosed medication was going on for almost one and a half years, with increasing dosage.

Within this time more than anything I lost trust on myself and my capacity to work. I couldn't make targets that I used to do prior pandemic.  Even after I got the correct diagnose, started treatments, and started going back to office my work wasn't getting a significant recovery. If I achieve targets one day, the next 2 weeks it'll be down. It lasted for 9 months when I was leaving to study abroad.

And now I'm doing my MBA, just finished my 1st semester which had 4 units to study. All 4 units had individual and group reports to work on. I wasn't able to submit any of the individual reports. Back in my bachelors I was able to work in group projects with not that much of a big deal. But this time my head was not processing even when I was working  with my friend. I understood the assignment and what to write, but just couldn't do the research and referencing. That was really bad. I probably have to redo this semester, I need to sort it out with my student advisers in the university. 

Has anybody faced similar issues? How can I come out of this rabbit hole?",2
148efta,How do you manage yourself at the end of the day when your meds run out?,"Okay so, I have an issue with my medication and it's really effecting my work life balance especially with my new job.

I've been on 70mg of vyvanse for the past year and a bit, as well as 5mg dexamphetamine in the after noon. Vyvanse dose not last long in me, I take it at 7-8am and by 1-3 I get major brain fog and feel like the laziest person on the planet, basic tasks feel like moving the world (feels like I am unmedicated however I'm hyper aware of it), if I just deal with it after about 3 hours I feel full of energy but my brain and thoughts turn to spaghetti and good luck to me trying to get any daily tasks done.

My doc prescribed be dexamphetamine in the afternoon at around 1-2 to, as he stated ""bridge the gap"" however when I take dex I feel my personality shifts a little, I'm much more agitated and potentially more aggressive? (Idk the best word to use). So I decided not to take the dex in the afternoon and just use the one vyvanse in the morning.

I'm looking for advice from people in similar situations and how they manage the dip that happens in the afternoon.

What I've done and do so far. 
‚Ä¢ I drink and protein shake or eat a protein heavy meal along with my vyvanse in the morning.
‚Ä¢ at around 12 I usually have another protein shake or  protein heavy meal.
‚Ä¢ just tonight I'm starting a strict sleep schedule where I sleep at 11:15pm and awake at 7am to try get exactly 5 rem cycles (god knows if this will work but I need to fix my lethargy and sleep regardless)

Additional important notes: I have an auto immune disease (ankylosing spondylitis) that one of the major side effects is fatigue. I have dsylexia also. I have lazy eye which also causes pretty bad fatigue especially when 90% of my job is Infront of a monitor and my lazy eye is really bad with near objects, have to strain to keep my vision as one.

148ee5u,I don't know how I'm going to be able to finish uni,"I'm in uni, in second year, out of three, and I've been struggling immensely. First year was also pretty difficult for me, but I was able to more easily figure things out since we were learning more of the basics and I could find basically everything explained on the internet, from scratch. That, combined with class notes, combined with a friend who knew a lot more stuff than I did and was really sweet and patient helping me understand, got me through the first year in the end.

Last semester was pretty rough, but somehow I passed everything. This semester though, I've already failed one subject, as you could only get a passing grade if you had enough assignments turned in, and I wasn't able to turn in anything besides the first. The problem was that the teacher would give us bare minimum info and then let us study alone, and I can't do that for the life of me. I simply couldn't find something to help me grasp enough of the subject to be able to do my homework, and I lacked the emotional capacity to reach out to people to hang out or chat, so I refrained from asking the friend that got me through the first year for help.

Now, I've been struggling to finish my last homework to get a passing grade in another subject, and after a meltdown because of the overwhelm, I decided to ask my friend for help. And he was understandably upset that I didn't reach out to him much to talk this semester, and had already helped me with another homework, at this same subject, plus the first one at the one I failed, and told me I'm on my own on this one (I didn't tell him I needed this to pass bc I didn't wanna feel like I was forcing his hand).

And I simply can't do it, I've been at it for days, and constanlty fighting with my brain to try and get it done, but I keep getting stuck, and now I'm afraid I'll fail this subject too. Which would be terrible, since next year is my final one, and I would have to go through all of this again, plus my bachelor's project and exam more or less at the same time, and I genuinely doubt I could do it without support.

Like im pressing buttons im executing things well but visually i feel like im having a focus issue. I really dont know how to pin point it perfectly but it feels as if im having a hard time processing things if there are many informations like the health bar and skill bar and then the character then i cant really seem to focus at them at once i will find myself only looking at my own character doing things.

When the other character attacks me or making moves i feel line my brain fogs.. especially if he is moving so fast i cant seem to know whats coming next

This feeling is really absurd because again I CANT REALLY PIN POINT IT OR EXPRESS IT WELL i just know that there is something off.

Not to mention games that has lots of details exausts me... i cant really memorize the places and i get lost most of time i just wander around hoping to god i find the way accidentally.

I‚Äôve been on several antidepressants since I was 17 (I was deeply depressed/eating disorder and hospitalised, but got better) but my energy has never been 100% since. 
Last year I got diagnosed with ADD. 
I went to 12 different psychologists/psychiatrists/doctors in total since my depression.

148cve0,I Am Ashamed To Have ADHD.,"I know how that sounds. Patronizing, rude, probably hurtful to people with it worse than me. But let me explain. I‚Äôm 23 years old, starting a good career in the public sector. I recently starting seeing a therapist for other issues in my life and was formally diagnosed with ADHD. I started researching symptoms and causes and presentation, and suddenly it all made sense. My inability to commit to any routine for longer than a few weeks, chronic fatigue and nodding off during meetings and classes, hyper-fixating on new hobbies for a couple weeks before moving on to something else, lost items or paperwork, and never following through on commitments. Everything I had thought for the last 2 decades made me immature, unreliable, lazy, dull suddenly had a cause and it wasn‚Äôt my fault. Or was it? The more I found I could relate my shortcomings to ADHD symptoms, the more it felt like I was searching for an excuse or the easy way out. It was so easy to say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault, it‚Äôs my brain‚Äù I became worried I was just blaming everything on a newfound crutch. Then the thoughts started to creep in of,
 ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have ADHD, I‚Äôm an adult‚Äù. 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what THOSE kids have‚Äù. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than this.‚Äù
And that led to self loathing. Why can‚Äôt I be normal? Why can‚Äôt my brain just work? Why do I, an otherwise healthy young adult, need to take medication every morning to function like a member of society? 
I guess this is more of a rant at this point, but if anyone else feels this way or has felt this way, please speak up so I don‚Äôt feel so alone. Maybe then I can break out of this and start to accept and move towards treatment and betterment than hiding in the shadows of my own mind.",21

148c9ol,ADHD Treatment with Medication,"Hi, I‚Äôm hoping there are some other people who have been in a similar situation as I and can offer their advice. I was diagnosed with ADHD a year ago (Age 24), and have been adamant that I didn‚Äôt want to be on medication. My thinking was two things: 

1) I‚Äôd done my whole life so far without it, so why should I start now when I can do therapy instead? 

2) I have suffered from extreme anxiety in the past due to health concerns or hypochondria, and one thing that almost certainly made it worse was stimulants of any kind. I used to have 3-4 panic attacks a day and have worked very hard in therapy to overcome that and it petrifies me that taking stimulants could bring this back on. 

However, my life is getting more difficult to deal with by the day. I really struggle with RSD and my attention span. Recently I‚Äôve been avoiding talking to my friends for fear they won‚Äôt reply and I‚Äôll be left thinking they‚Äôre angry or upset with me & that they‚Äôre never going to speak to me. This in turn is making me more anxious as I don‚Äôt feel like I have anyone to talk to.

I‚Äôm 16. I‚Äôm in Year 11. I‚Äôm doing 5 subjects, and without fail, every term, I have flunked at least one. Admittedly, I get very good marks in the subjects I‚Äôm motivated for. But only the ones I‚Äôm motivated for. And I am scared shitless that I won‚Äôt be able to graduate.

I still have no motivation to do it. My anxiety is weighed out by my ADHD and my depression and now I can barely complete assignments let alone even think about doing my Certificate II.

But now if I fail even one subject I won‚Äôt be able to graduate.

He has tried a variety of meds, etc, but he found they made him too anxious, so he is currently unmedicated. We are awaiting another psych appointment to set him right.

The problem is that he has started college doing something he said he wanted to do. The moment exams hit, he is freaking out and I only learned today that he hasn't been studying. Today he says he hates it and wants to quit. This was his pattern in school - he coasted through with a very high IQ and ability to get good grades with low effort. 

Nobody knew he was ADHD until late highschool when the pressure started to cripple him.

He has mentioned feeling like a freak because he can't handle ""normal"" life like others, and that he feels like a total failure. He wants to quit college. 

I'm not sure how to guide him through life. I don't understand why he doesn't use my great ability to structure and focus to help him - he says it doesn't help him. My ways don't work for him, but i don't know what will, or what does, and he won't let me help at all. He is frustrated that I ""Don't get it"", and then he gets angry for ""not helping"" when I am trying to understand and help and read everything, but I'm still unable to help, it seems.

148amfa,UK ADHD brains! You can get an Access Card which means no more queueing in UK theme parks plus more benefits!,"Me and my family love theme parks, but absolutely hate queuing. I‚Äôm ADHD (dx 3 years ago) and our youngest is on the pathway for assessment.

Our kids have got a random INSET Day in July so we‚Äôre going to Chessington (using Clubcard vouchers so it‚Äôs free) and I checked out their Accessibility requirements to see if I qualified for anything.

That‚Äôs how I found the Nimbus Access Card system. It‚Äôs all online and was super easy to apply for my card. I only selected the Queuing and Standing benefit, but there‚Äôs loads of others on there to support guests with a range of disabilities. It‚Äôs ¬£15 and it‚Äôs good for 3 years.

I was approved by email just over a week later and then applied for my Merlin Ride Access Pass which was instantly approved and FREE. This gives me and up to 3 others virtual queueing.

From what I‚Äôve worked out so far, when I get to the park I follow a link in my email which takes me to the ride access system. Once there I choose which ride I want to go on, say The Gruffalo. If there‚Äôs a physical queue of 45 mins then a timer starts on my phone for 45 mins. At the end of the timer, we can go to the ride and get straight on without physically queueing. Once the ride is complete, I can then select our next ride and the virtual queue starts again.

You can apply for a card on behalf of your child as well.

So, I was put on anti-depressants. But the anti-depressants didn't really help me feel ""better"", just more apathetic, so instead of giving me the relief I needed to solve my problems, i just stopped caring about them, so i stopped even bothering with them, which just made them snowball.

What's worse is that since I went off the meds, I'm having a harder time feeling good about anything (especially anything having to do with myself), which, in turn, is making any kind of motivation that much more difficult.

1489jc8,UPDATE - From a father of an eight-year-old boy with ADHD...,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/13vlf8u/from_a_father_of_an_eightyearold_boy_with_adhd/)

(TLDR: My kid is having trouble at school. At the request of the school director, I'm putting together a video explaining some of the challenges my son faces, and how they might be able to help. People correctly remarked that my video was going to be WAY too long, so I've worked at shortening it, but I think it's still too long, and I'd love some more advice, if possible.)

Everyone here was SUPER helpful with the suggestions! Truly, THANK YOU so much. I‚Äôve drastically reduced the length of this (by more than half), but it will still be about a 10 minute video, and I‚Äôd ideally like to get it down to five. Here‚Äôs the newest version, below, of what I‚Äôm planning to say in it. Does anyone here have any ideas as to what else I can cut out, without sacrificing important information that my son‚Äôs school should know about? And for those who remember the previous version, did I cut out anything that I shouldn't have? Warning: There's still a lot of text below, so obviously, no hard feelings it's too hard for anyone to process. I realize I'm in /r/ADHD. Anyway, here it goes:

Hi, Everyone. Mike Michaels here, father of Lenny Michaels. Please excuse me when you see my eyes reading everything I‚Äôm saying here. There are a lot of details and nuance to it all, so I wanted to be prepared, rather than just ‚Äòwinging it.‚Äô I also really want to thank all of you for being so patient with Lenny. I know that most schools aren‚Äôt, and for this, we‚Äôre really grateful to you guys.

Today, I wanted to talk about five different things pertaining to Lenny. Here‚Äôs thing number one, and it‚Äôs the most important, and really, I‚Äôve only begun to fully understand this myself over the last couple of months: Lenny has a DISABILITY. ADHD is a disability; it‚Äôs an almost invisible disability. Yes, it‚Äôs also accurately classified as a ‚Äúdisorder,‚Äù but most people who don‚Äôt have a career in psychology, like me, tend to think of disorders as not being as debilitating as disabilities can be. But make no mistake, ADHD is ALSO a disability, with a variety of negative repercussions for the people afflicted by it.

Now, this may all go against layperson thinking ‚Äì I certainly didn‚Äôt used to think of it as a disability myself until I saw it so closely and frequently, but now I have no doubt now that it absolutely is a disability, which affects memory, time interpretation, impulsivity, and other things known as ‚Äúexecutive function.‚Äù The ‚Äúattention deficit‚Äù and ‚Äúhyperactivity‚Äù are really just symptoms, and not causes. Still, it would benefit all of us watching this video to start reframing this in our minds as a disability that Lenny has ‚Äì and it would also benefit Lenny, and the other kids that his behavior affects, if all of us here modify our thinking about ADHD, without explicitly telling the other kids that he has a disability, unless and until he wants that revealed to them.

I just wanted to mention this disability component to offer some additional perspective on some of his actions. For him, and others like him, it‚Äôs more than just ‚Äúnot trying hard enough.‚Äù It‚Äôs that his brain is physically different, and changing this just isn‚Äôt possible without certain interventions.

It's widely accepted that it‚Äôs not right to press a wheelchair user to ‚Äújust get up the stairs,‚Äù without some kind of intervention, like a ramp or an elevator. And in that same way, it shouldn‚Äôt be asked of an ADHD-ridden kid to ‚Äújust remember,‚Äù without some kind of intervention, as well, or they‚Äôre gonna feel like garbage. Of course, these things aren‚Äôt identical, but they‚Äôre similar enough to illustrate the point that interventions are necessary, and that pressing a kid to do something that they can‚Äôt is damaging.

As an aside, Lenny also has something called Sensory Processing Disorder. This disorder is observed often enough in children with ADHD,  and in children without it. But in Lenny, his Sensory Processing Disorder causes him to feel a need for pressure in his joints and against his body. This is why you may see him pressing against things more often than others, or pulling things, or knocking things down. He has a compulsion towards feeling those things in his joints, in his body. He also has a compulsion related to his auditory sense, where his brain needs to hear loud, explosive things, and so this is why you may see him press other kids that have big reactions, and stay away from kids that don‚Äôt. And where someone without ADHD may be able to pause, and recognize that acting on these compulsions would be inappropriate at times, Lenny‚Äôs ADHD generally prevents him from doing so.

And that brings me to thing number two: It‚Äôs important to not make Lenny feel inferior for not being able to remember important things at certain moments ‚Äì he just can‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôve always sort of known this, and sort of understood it, but as someone without ADHD myself, I only came to this full understanding recently, when I told him to not do something a couple of weeks ago, and literally two minutes later, he did it. I was upset. We spoke after, and even though he remembered that I said it during this aftermath conversation, he genuinely couldn‚Äôt bring that information into his mind while he was doing it.

And then he cried, maybe because I had upset him with my tone, but I think it was more because he felt inferior for not being able to recall this important information when he needed it, and because I unintentionally rubbed this in his face. And this was my lightbulb moment. Already, he sometimes says to me, ‚ÄúDaddy, why can‚Äôt I do these things like other kids can,‚Äù and of course, I try to explain and comfort him, but it wasn‚Äôt until this specific incident, that I just mentioned, that I connected these things ‚Äì his disability impairs his recall, and then this causes him to do actions that he doesn‚Äôt really want to do, and then he feels shitty about, even if he‚Äôs outwardly laughing sometimes to cover the embarrassment. So now, rather than unintentionally rubbing it in his face like I used to, even gently, I try to not harp on the fact that he can‚Äôt recall these things when he needs to, and I instead try to work with him, constructively, on reminders that he thinks will help him recall pertinent information when he needs to. I hope that all of you will truly take this to heart, and please try the same.

I think this is also important when other kids grill him for not remembering, too. Of course, that‚Äôs how they feel, and they should be able to say it ‚Äì they‚Äôve probably said the same thing to Lenny dozens of times, and their frustration is entirely justified, and should be expressed. But from where I‚Äôm standing, instead of teachers jumping on that same wagon, and grilling Lenny just the same way about remembering things, even gently ‚Äì as I used to ‚Äì Lenny has expressed to me that it would help for teachers to assist him in expressing back to the other kids that he has this ‚Äúthing‚Äù in his brain (he‚Äôs embarrassed to call it ADHD in front of other people) that makes it hard to remember things that he needs to, even if he's been told these things hundreds of times, and maybe then they ‚Äì Lenny and the other kid that he‚Äôs meeting with ‚Äì can work together to identify some useful in-the-moment reminders that can help him have this in-the-moment recall, right when things start, before they escalate.

And with that, I want to talk about the third thing: The reminders. For adults with ADHD, they have smart phones, with reminders that ping up all the time to remind them of things that non-ADHD people, like me, can remember without these tools. Or, adults will also put up sticky notes at the locations where these reminders are needed. Even kids at traditional schools can use post-its at their desks. But for Lenny, this doesn‚Äôt apply. So maybe, if we can identify areas of the yard where certain problems happen consistently, and other areas of the yard, where different problems happen consistently, maybe we can put up a little sign, or a sticker, or a poop emoji picture that will catch his eye, and serve as a reminder. In fact, this leads me to another revelation I recently had about these reminders‚Ä¶

I used to think that, when teachers are around, Lenny respects limits more because he fears the consequences if he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äì he figures, I used to think, that the teachers will see Lenny creating a problem, and they‚Äôll get upset, so he‚Äôs more on guard when they‚Äôre watching. However, in light of the recent incident that I mentioned before (and many others like it), I‚Äôm starting to rethink this. While that still may be true, I think this is more likely: Lack of teachers‚Äô eyes on him doesn‚Äôt cause him to actively think, ‚ÄúOh, now‚Äôs my chance to do what I‚Äôm not supposed to!‚Äù Rather, lack of teachers‚Äô eyes on him give him no reminder to recall that he‚Äôs not supposed to do it. When he notices teachers watching, he doesn‚Äôt restrain himself because he fears consequences, he restrains himself because noticing the teachers‚Äô eyes remind him to.

The fourth thing I wanted to talk about involves tapering Lenny onto and off of different medications that we may try. Of course, the other kids won‚Äôt know when this is happening, but I‚Äôve asked Marlon to at least please let all of the teachers know when it is, so that, hopefully, all of you can please extend your already generous patience a bit further anytime this is happening. As many of you know, problems were heightened a handful of weeks ago. What you may not have known, or had full color on, is that these heightened problems coincided exactly with tapering Lenny onto a new medication, and then back off of it again, one week later, when it didn‚Äôt work.

But while he was on it, there were more problems, and the school‚Äôs tolerance got very low, and Lenny felt very punished for actions that were, unknown-to-him, caused by chemical reactions that we ‚Äì more or less ‚Äì forced on him, against his will, with pills. And for that, I feel terrible; yes, the recipient children were also treated unfairly, of course, but I also think this was unfair to Lenny, for him to feel ‚Äúless than‚Äù for a root cause (i.e. the new medication) that was implemented by us. To continue to try to improve everyone‚Äôs experience, we‚Äôre going to try to work with Lenny‚Äôs psychiatrist to experiment with new medications and dosages, but it‚Äôs likely that some of them won‚Äôt work at all, and that others might make things worse, too. And so, in the future, when this happens, now that you have this understanding, I really hope that you‚Äôll please expand your already-vast tolerance just a little bit further, knowing that, in those situations, it really is the meds, and not the kid.

And finally, there‚Äôs a fifth thing I wanted to discuss, a point that Marlon had brought up with me: He suggested that it might benefit us all to help Lenny empathize, so that perhaps some of the impulses dissipate, and then the reminders of those situations aren‚Äôt necessary. Well, unfortunately, empathy is also a component of executive function, so, even though I love the idea, I‚Äôm just not sure it‚Äôs going to work. But as long as we approach it gently, careful to not make him feel less than if he can‚Äôt do it, I certainly see no harm in trying. All of you are better trained than I am in helping children empathize with others, so I‚Äôll follow your lead on this.

And really, that‚Äôs about it for now. Again, I really want to thank all of you SO MUCH for being SO PATIENT in ways that most other people just aren‚Äôt. The fact that you‚Äôve even watched this entire video, with my ugly mug rambling, lets me know that you care about Lenny more than almost anyone else does. I think that if we can all remember to gently and discretely treat his ADHD as a disability, and not make him feel inferior for its symptoms ‚Äì especially memory, and help him with discrete reminders, and be a bit more patient when we‚Äôre trying new meds, and help him with empathy ‚Äì even though that might not work ‚Äì if we try all of these things, life will be easier, and just more fun, for everyone, including all of the kids. Lenny does belong at this school, party because this school is renowned for its acceptance of different types of children; he just needs accommodations for his particular disability. So, thank you again, and if you want to ask me any questions, or discuss any of this with me, please feel free to call me anytime. My phone number is 555-555-5555. Thanks again!",3
1489j0k,Advice on navigating the shortage..,"Hello!

(ADHD-PI 30yr F)
I am going on month 2 of not having meds in University Place, Washington US. I have taken all of my back up scripts that i just so happend to have from when I first started meds and was wary to take them. I just cannot focus at work and being off my meds is starting to effect my relationship with my partner. It's getting bad, and i need to do something about it at this point.
For reference on the medication I take and a brief history:
I am supposed to be on dextroamphetamine ER 15mg once daily, but with the shortage, i can't find my prescription or anything similar in stock at literally all of the pharmacies in a 20 mile radius.
I have tried adderall and wellbutrin and those gave me very bad physiological side effects.
I am also currently on effexor 37mg and prazosin  by night.

If anyone has any tips or suggestions on maybe supplements or alternative medications that worked out for them after taking dex since the shortage, I am open minded to any advices!

Thank you!",1
1489hvn,What helps you get work done?,"I‚Äôve been feeling really bad lately about how I‚Äôm doing in school. I transferred to a university last year and am honestly struggling.

My primary care doctor doesn‚Äôt listen to me when I say I don‚Äôt want to rely on medication, especially since it doesn‚Äôt really help with me getting my work done. I just end up focusing on the wrong thing. Like just now I spent forever on this drawing instead of writing my final paper. I was really interested in the assignment too but spent way too long on this small drawing portion instead of the actual assignment and basically had to half a** it to get it turned in on time :/ 

Is there anything you‚Äôve done that has helped you to get things like schoolwork done? I really want to do well, but I can‚Äôt get out of this cycle.",1

I'm not thinking of working since I'll be applying for a master's program (which accepts students through an exam) next year. During this one year gap, I need to study for the master's exam and if I land the internships I need to be as productive as possible. Ritalin does something for me but not much and I won't be seeing my psychiatrist for let's say 2 months because it's super expensive.

I saw his e-mails about 3pm asking where I was, I sent him a reply explaining and apologising, he hasn‚Äôt replied, I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to get a very angry e-mail from him.

14894mo,Task apps for us,"I dunno about you but I tend to go though about 4/5 'productivity' apps each year.  When I find a new one I'm so excited, I try to fill it in with my massive mental list of things I've never done but usually only remember a few things. Not to worry! I'll use this every morning and night to add things in my mind and I'll opt in to all their reminders.

I usually last a few days until U realise that either the app isn't what I really wanted as it's not perfect for me because I'm soooooo unique. Or the effort to enter things because too great, or I can't commit to a due date so I put a date in the future for all the tasks and of course don't do them.

So I wondered what a wish list of features would be for the ultimate ADHD app. Then I'm going that someone smart will read this and build it because that's way out of my league!

I'll start .. I want to be able to create tasks by talking to the app when I remember them. Like today in the car I remembered for the millionth time that I need to put some double sided tape to fix the microphone to the dash. I remembered it now too but still won't do it

1488om9,"I need a reality check, am I childish?","I really need a reality check because I am unsure if I'm just being lazy and childish. 

So yesterday was kinda a tough day, my boyfriend and I both had a stressful day. I visited him and we mutually agreed to do nothing all day and watch anime (except buying groceries). 
At some point we talked about how the bed kinda stinks, but I didn't connect the dots and continued watching anime. 
After the episode he said we should change the bedding, I kinda protested because I just didn't want to, I hate changing the bed, it's one of the things I always avoid in doing. 
He jokingly pressured me, but I complied because i didn't want to feel like a child being stubborn. I did it but really unmotivated, i didn't say anything just my movement, so he commented about that so I stopped and pulled myself together but was kinda frustrated even more and didn't talk much i guess because after it he asked me if I'm annoyed at him and I said that I don't know but I really didn't want to do it so hebresponded with ""it's not easy for me either"" and I know he didn't mean it like that but it felt like he said to me that I need to suck it up and not be such a child. Today we talked about it again and he meant with it that he didn't have the motivation either but we are quicker if we do it  together, and I get that but somehow It still felt bad hearing that, because he didn't wanna donit but still did it so why am I being so childish. I also told him that I didn't have time to prepare myself for changing the sheets and I had to adapt myself to his pace which made me more frustrated and in my head we were just going to chill and I know he didn't know it beforehand but this change in plans really threw me off. Oh and I forgot to mention that I was just recently diagnosed with adhd, were are together for 2 years.

So yeah please give me a reality check, am I just being childish?",2

UPDATE: 
FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR CONCERN !! i have read all your comments and it was extremely helpfull, i also highly recommend every single one of you reading this right now to check the commentd yourself since people are giving wondrrful advice down here üòä   i was not expecting to receive so many comments. I was going to delete this post since i felt abit ashamed and stupid, but i won't since it might help others in learning to defend themselves and set boundaries !  ( especially younger people with classmates and stuff, like me). I talked to her and i told her that i won't give her some of my medicine since that isn't allowed and could actually get me in big problems. First off all getting help and diagnosed was very difficult for me and took alot of time, alot of time and energy that i and nobody else should take for granted. I openly told her that her question was very rude and  explained to her how dangerous and stupid the consequenses are. She got offended by it and i basically told her to fuck off and to never bother me again with such stupid questions.  I have always been an person who wants to be liked by others, but as i am getting older i am starting to realise how important it is to not allow yourself to get pushed over and to stand up for yourself. There are some mean people out there who try to abuse others kindness and you should always be carefull to not allow it. When i wrote this question earlier in the morning i was very saddened and angry since i am usually not very open about my issues, i had taken that step  to tell her about this and when she later on tried to ask me for some medicine i ofcourse felt that something sketchy was going on with her. SO !!! INCASE THAT THIS EVER HAPPENS TO YOU, NEVER  SHARE YOUR MEDICINE. Explain to them that it is a very bad idea, most people will understand and reflect on themselves. And if they get offended like in my case then all i can say is that is is much better to cut out toxic people from your life.

Ps:  i find writing in english abit difficult

I know that the title sounds weird but it is something that bothers me a bit . I take 20 mg of methylfenidaat daily and an friend of mine has recently asked me if i can give her some of my medicine since she is not able to get it herself. She had told me that she had gotten diagnosed with adhd and that she is taking medicine for it aswell but now  she has asked me for this favor. My life and mental health isn't the best currently and i have a hard time judging situations and making decisions. Am i an asshole for not wanting to give her some of my medication ?  should i just be polite and give her some, i mean she could rrally be struggling and perhaps it would help her ? But on the other hand if i have to be honest i actually really dont want to share my medication with anyone, but i fear that this person will stop talking to me and change their opinion on me if i dont share some with them",121

1487itz,The struggle with showers,"For as long as I can remember, I have hated showers. When I was little, my poor mother would have to bargain and fight to get me in the shower. I hated getting in; however, once I was in, I didn‚Äôt want out either. Then it was a fight to get me out of the shower.

I‚Äôm now older and responsible for my own hygiene, but it is a STRUGGLE. Getting in is hard, and I delay it for as long as possible. Like sit on the bathroom floor staring at the shower dreading it. It‚Äôs wet and I don‚Äôt want to get in. Once I‚Äôve finally dragged myself into the shower, I don‚Äôt want out. I‚Äôll sit on the shower floor in the hot water doing nothing and playing on my phone because for some reason I hate the feeling of washing myself. Typically after sitting on the floor in the shower for roughly 20-30 minutes I finally wash myself in 5-10 minutes, and then I dread getting out. It‚Äôs cold and dry and I don‚Äôt like it. This is another 5-10 minutes.

It‚Äôs so bad it causes anxiety around it. Some days I‚Äôll sit on the floor thinking about what‚Äôs coming, and eventually decide it‚Äôs not worth it. It‚Äôs embarrassing, but I often go days, possibly a week without taking a proper shower just because of how much anxiety it gives me.

1487ef9,I wish I could get rid of my ADHD honestly,"I'm struggling with my ADHD. There's no elegant way I can put it. It's a constant battle to try and get things done especially with work. 

Around the house I'm perfectly fine. Not too disorderly, but there's a method to the madness most days. But I can accomplish most things.

Work on the other hand is something different. I struggle at work constantly. I start on a low dose of Adderall (7.5mg) but it's not helping me at all. I struggle to complete tasks. Half the time trying to finish projects feels like I'm attempting to climb mount everest. Lately everything is starting to feel like a Herculean effort to get one task accomplished. It just starts making me feel defeated half the time. It's like my brain doesn't want to function and only acts on impulse half the time. I constantly struggle with staying on task, remembering information, and/or distractions. I just want to be able to get through a project and not have to wait until the last second to finish. All of my coworkers make everything look easy and constantly struggle with getting one thing done.

I feel like I am always struggling with work and everybody makes it seem easy to do. I feel like I'm lazy and I know it's my brain not wanting to work correctly. I know I'm seeking treatment but it's taking too long to figure things out. I think my work is not patient enough to meet what I should be accomplishing. I feel like I'm constantly getting undermined by my own self's inability to handle things. 

I really wish I could just go get zapped and get cured of my ADHD. I know we're supposed to be positive about everything and positivity when it comes to mental health. I feel like my ADHD hinders my ability to function in a society and I struggle with it. It feels so overwhelming having to keep trying to fit into a box I was never meant to fit in but that's not what society wants or cares about. 

I really wish it was just gone. I would wake up one day and I don't have to deal with ADHD anymore. I'm so tired and exhausted from struggling constantly against my own self.

But that wasn't even the problem, I mean all the English tests I did pass them well.   
The real problem was my bloody memory. I can't remember phrases, words, addresses, numbers,  I can't remember anything!

It's so frustrating and annoying that someone tells me something and I immediately forget it, I honestly got no RAM!  
 It feels like I will be forever the ""lord of the approximated knowledge"" cuz can't remember anything well.

My question is has anyone tried hiring a personal assistant who can either do these kinds of tasks or keep them accountable for the stuff you need to do. Even just providing body doubling during work hours would go a long way. I have trouble getting in on time and staying on task if I'm not accountable to someone.

This was all after she told me she knows ‚Äúreal‚Äù autistics because she teaches special ed, despite my clinical ASD diagnosis (ADHD dx for 20 years)‚Ä¶which was after they couldn‚Äôt explain to me the difference between autism and ASD with the DSM-V open in front of them or how you can have ASD and _not_ be autistic. I found them looking for therapists who specialize in ADHD and/or ASD. She was an ADHD ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù tf.

I‚Äôm only looking for a therapist because my life and work outlook is pretty damn bleak rn, my current therapist doesn‚Äôt have availability to up my sessions to once a week again after dropping down to once a month almost a year ago (been seeing her for ~3 years), and my few friends are all too busy to talk. 

I‚Äôm fucking struggling to get on the struggle bus and literally everyone I talk to tells me basically I just need to wait until shit gets worse for anything to be done, but the only ‚Äòworse‚Äô scenario I can think of is one where I‚Äôm not here, even though I‚Äôm looking, even begging for help at every fucking avenue. I have dope ass benefits, but look and talk as if nothing should be wrong with me, which I am constantly reminded of. Then this quack shows up after 2 months of desperately trying to get the right help and feeling near complete hopelessness.

14839rz,insurance wont cover my vyvanse unless i try everything else first,"when i was a kid i went thru just about every adhd medication available before we arrived at vyvanse. it worked well for me and the side effects were manageable. i stopped taking meds 5 years ago when i wasnt in school anymore, but im starting college in the fall and knew i would need it. so i got back on vyvanse. 

i have been taking it for 4 days and i got a call from my doctor saying my insurance wouldn‚Äôt cover it until i have exhausted other adhd medication options‚Ä¶. most of which i have already tried. so im starting concerta in a few days when my vyvanse runs out. when i was younger i know it caused tummy aches and i wouldnt eat while i took it. 

im just feeling really frustrated and overwhelmed with the whole situation. i just want my vyvanse, even the low dose (10mg) i started taking worked really well! i am scared to start a new med and have to potentially go thru the wringer again just to arrive on the conclusion we came to when i was a kid.",2

Each time, in the moment, I somehow came to the realization that I did not want to be a statistic. Yet another person with ADHD that died young.

1484h61,The truly awful parts of adhd- it‚Äôs ruining my life,"I‚Äôm sure I haven‚Äôt even scratched the surface of how bad adhd can get, but right now it‚Äôs ruining my life. I‚Äôm 18, diagnosed at 16, and on strattera for a year‚Ä¶ or so? Now‚Ä¶ 

I was never medicated in high school and it ruined me, I always feel like I could‚Äôve done better if I had gotten the help I needed. I took a year off and am now taking college classes online. 

My problem is, I don‚Äôt think. I literally don‚Äôt think. I‚Äôm dealing with medical issues right now and I miss really important- hard to get- appointments bc I get the time wrong. I am running late for everything. I don‚Äôt answer important phone calls and I miss really big information and deadlines. College hasn‚Äôt even started. I recently decided my life would be better with a new pet, and it has torn me apart. I tried to post somewhere else about my new pet making my life miserable already (it‚Äôs been 2 weeks) and was told I was dramatic and bought him on impulse and a horrible person. 

It didn‚Äôt feel like impulse. It felt like a good decision but I keep thinking‚Ä¶ what if I just thought about it longer?

I‚Äôve lost the motivation to do anything and I‚Äôm just dragging myself along.

What do I do? Why do I do these things to myself? It seems like I don‚Äôt care and I don‚Äôt think but I swear I do. I try so hard but I forget and I mess up, it seems like every time.

1484xm7,My ADHD experience with diet.,"Another user (u/chaimatchalatte ) asked for clarification on a comment I made. This is that:

I'm in my 40's.  I wasn't diagnosed until my 20's. I didn't find the right doctor and medication until about 5 years ago. Growing up, I was ""that guy,"" who was ALWAYS sick. It's not a stretch to say that I was the first AND last person to get practically every cold that went around. I constantly had bronchitis. Oddly, I rarely had the flu. I didn't start getting pneumonia at least annually until my mid 20's. (By the time I hit 30, I was also diagnosed with a variation of Asthma...which contributes to how easily I get head colds.) 

About a year into working with the right ADHD doc on the right meds (about a year before COVID hit), I figured it would be a good time to change my diet. (I should also note that every 2-3 months, I take 10-14 days off of my meds to re-normalize my body...I do this in effort to not need to increase my dose of vyvanse, and it's mostly been successful). So I grabbed an app that counts calories. Whatever I ate, I put in the app. It tracked my calories...and having that information at instant retrieval is dangerous because I'll see numbers and realize that I need to change something. During spring\\summer (when I'm working outside a lot), I tend to consume over 4000 calories per day. Hard to lose any weight with that much intake. But after 2 or 3 days, I'd be watching the numbers and would adjust my intake to match with my goals. 

At any rate, the app I grabbed was a keto food tracker. It had little red\\yellow\\green badges on each food, which I mostly ignored. 

That month I used the tracker happened to include 12 days that I was taking off meds.

After that first month, I'd lost some 10 or 15 lbs and was happy with that, but was playing around in the app...and found the big obvious section where it was tracking macronutrients. ...and because I hadn't been looking at that section the entire month...I hadn't been adjusting my carb\\protein\\fat intake. Only my total calories. So I had a month of ""pure"" macro data....that was showing me that I was eating \~80% carbs, \~15% fat, \~5% protein....near every day. I had no clue.

I found a protein shake that I could tolerate the taste and texture of, and started adding that to my daily routine, with my own goal of getting my macros into something more like 33/33/33 territory. It's been a life-changer for me. I don't get sick all the time anymore. In fact, I've never been as consistently healthy as these last few years...including the pandemic. I've only had one or two colds per year.

A few times, my macro-tracking showed that I had wandered into ketosis territory...and I hated those days. I was inordinately angry and irritable. 

I don't know that getting a more balanced macro nutrient intake does anything for ADHD symptoms, I do know that -for me- balancing them out has directly led to the most consistently healthy period of time in my life.",3

1486gjf,How can I find a psychopharmacologist that does patient care?,"Problem:
Per a PCPs recommendation, I need to find a psychiatrist that specializes in psychopharmacology so that they can reevaluate my ADHD diagnosis. I can‚Äôt figure out how to find a psychopharmacologist that I can schedule an appointment with. 

My Googling and Reddit searching leads me to believe psychopharmacologists don‚Äôt actually do patient care, they just work in research. 


*Simplified* Backstory:

I was under the care of a psychologist and a psychiatrist for the last 10 years.  I was diagnosed with ADHD and have been taking meds for a long time.

I‚Äôm currently on 20mg Vyvanse. I used to take a higher dose, and some other meds as well. My life got to a point where I couldn‚Äôt tell what was a side effect of a med I was taking vs what was a real issue. (Both psych and physical issues.) So I worked with my doctor to gradually get off my other meds and lower my Vyvanse dose. I actually got completely off of the Vyvanse as well for a few months and then recently restarted at 20mg because I was struggling with depression and anxiety. 

I recently moved to a different state and found a new PCP at a highly reputable health system. We reviewed my ongoing health issues at my new patient appointment. I mentioned that I‚Äôve been having mood issues lately, and was wondering if I need to go back on antidepressants. (It‚Äôs nearly impossible to get a new patient appointment with a reputable psychiatrist in this place, so I was hoping a PCP could help.) 

To my great surprise, this PCP felt quite strongly that I may have never needed stimulants or experienced ADHD symptoms had I not illegally taken Adderall in college.

She suggested that I find a psychopharmacologist and tell them my whole history: all the meds I‚Äôve taken and all my symptoms across time. She said they‚Äôd be able to tell me which of my experiences were caused by the things I took and come up with a plan to wean off my Vyvanse (possibly with low dose antidepressants to help with the transition).",0
148609t,OCD and Straterra,"Hi all, my 11 year old son has always had attention issues. He was diagnosed with ADD (no hyperactivity) a couple years back and had a lot of trouble concentrating in school. We've tried a couple of stimulant meds including Vyvanse, but they caused nightmares and voices in his head. A few months back, we tried straterra, was on it about a month, but his overall mood was depressed. His fun,  giddy personality was completely lost,  he just moped around,  and didn't talk hardly at all. The doctor increased him from 50 to 60 mg, because he hadn't improved his attention that much. About 2 days later, he started having violent thoughts. I was iffy on him taking this med to begin with, because of its effects on his personality, so we stopped it. That was about 4 weeks ago, and he's still having violent thoughts randomly but less,  and assures us he would never do the things that come into his head, and it bothers him immensely. He also sexualizes everything now, way beyond normal. 

I'm going to spare you the details,  but we think he's dealing with pure O OCD. He claims he never had any violent thoughts until that first day. I have read that ADD is often misdiagnosed when someone may have OCD. My son has racing thoughts, always has,  and I'm just wondering if it was coincidental that the ocd went into overdrive as puberty picked up and just happened to be on straterra. I've seen a few articles also linking straterra to ocd. 

He tends to bring up stories all day long, about something that happened yesterday,  last week,  years ago,  completely random. I ask why he thought if it, and he says I don't know,  it just popped in my head. So I know he has racing thoughts. 

Just thought I would get the community's take on this. Do any of you suffer from pure O, or did anyone here have a similar reaction to straterra, and if so, did it get better?",2
14864gq,Figuring this out takes so long...,"My brother was labeled with ADD as a kid. I struggled a lot as well, but was good with math. When I was first tested in elementary they said something about me being good at math ment I didn't have any problems... The insane frustrations I had with reading and spelling didn't seem to matter... Idk. 

We were able to get me some accommodations in High School. (I was the First student in my highschool to bring a laptop. I had to have special permission and sign a contract with the principal that I wouldn't play games in class üòù... This was 2002). 

I got officially diagnosed with ""Learning Disibility"" (The dr didn't have a name for it.) In my second year of University. Which was the best thing ever. This got me accomodations, the biggest being 1.5 time on tests and small rooms for them. I also got bursery for toutoring. It took 10 years to do a 5 year program but I graduated with a  Chemical Engineering degree. 

I understand School. I understand how I work, how I learn and what to do to accomodate myself. I don't understand life outside of school. I applied and applied to jobs and it went nowhere. I am so tired of it. 

I started looking into ADHD because of social media putting it in my head, but the dots are there. My brother is officially ADD, and my mom has always thought my Dad was. 

I started trying to get the diagnosis in September. My family dr sent a refural to a hospital psychiatrist in September. That office didn't contact me until mid January... they then told me that dr doesn't do ADHD digonsises... It was fine because I went and found another dr in December who I saw end of February. 

The dr in Feb said yes, you have ADHD. I will give your Family dr a report. I am sure I was told 6-8 weeks... There is still no report, nad when I called today they said it takes 6 months!!!! 

My Family dr agreed to try me on meds in December. I am taking Concerta. I was taking the genetic, it was giving me anxiety at 4:30 every day. A big spike of it. My Family dr said let's get the Brand name. So after a fight with insurance I get the Brand name, been taking it 3 weeks now, it was fine at first but all last week I was having anxiety all the time, it's a milder version than the generic was but it's All The Time now... By Thursday last week I was just a mess. 

I decided to not take it on Friday, and the anxiety got better. I was fairly productive yesterday. But this morning I just felt overwhelmed by everything. I saw emails I had missed, and things I had forgotten and there was just so much. Everything is just so much. 

I am seeing the hospital psychiatrist on Wednesday. I have been waiting and waiting for this. I work for a call center, but got a dr note for a medical leave mid April because I just completely brokedown. 

I feel so stuck. I feel so done with my own BS. So tired of waiting on doctors... I don't know how to function. I don't know how to people. I don't really even know what to do now that I have the ADHD digonsises. I feel like there should be more I am doing than just the meds but I don't know what... I am in a mental health outpatient program, and have therapy but like I am so stuck. 

I just wanted to write this out. I don't know what you all can do to help, but I wanted to share my story.",1

1485kfu,How do people deal with stimulant side effects? (new to stims),"Hey,

&#x200B;

So I'm 32, recently diagnosed with ADHD, was started on Vyvanse 30 mg. The actual effects of the medication, in regards to what the targets are for treatment, have been good. Definitely noticed a difference, as well as my wife. However, the side effects are near intolerable. I'm wondering if others have had this experience and if there are any non-medication related tips? (The medication part I can speak with my psychiatrist about).

\- Teeth clenching 

\- Hands shaking

\- Zero appetite

\- Mental benefits wear off after 6 hours but physical discomfort lasts for \~14. Take it at 9:00 AM and can hardly eat or sleep until 2:00-4:00 AM.

\- Speaking of the 6 hours, total and absolute crash and a rebound of symptoms that make me feel 100x more disorganized than with no medication for a good few hours. I work 10 hour days, so this isn't particularly working. 

\- Intractable dry mouth 

&#x200B;

Things I have tried:  

\- Taking medication with a big meal 

\- Eliminating morning coffee (I only was having a small cup anyway)

\- Supplementing diet with smoothies, protein bars/shakes (not an acceptable long-term solution for me)

&#x200B;

I have one friend and a family member also on Vyvanse, and this is not their experience at all. They told me they don't experience a ""crash"" and more so just are able to notice that the medication has worn off. Any lifestyle changes that people have done in order to cope with side effects  would be greatly appreciated, as there are clear benefits, but I don't think I can tolerate this level of side effects.",1

14851gw,I never learnt how to study,"(Note that I haven't been diagnosed yet, but I'm in the process of getting diagnosed for ADHD and/or autism, and unfortunately, it's taking quite a long time.)

I'm currently in uni, and this year I ended up skipping most of my classes and cramming all of the subject matter a few days before my exams. This approach used to work in high school, but now it doesn't, understandibly. Sometimes, miraculously, it does work, and I manage to pass, but it doesn't feel good because I haven't actually learned anything. I'm struggling with knowing how to study effectively. In high school, I could get by with minimal effort and still achieve high grades, so I never developed proper study habits. 

I've never experienced the feeling of failing an exam due to the complexity of the course itself. Whenever I failed an exam, it was because I didn't study enough in advance, so I never had the opportunity to fully grasp all the course material.

I'm not sure if this post is me seeking advice or simply venting, but it would be helpful to gain some insight from someone who has gone through or is going through a similar experience. Thank you!

1483o90,"ADHD- I feel like I've tried everything, yet I still cannot manage.","Hello,  


I've been diagnosed with ADHD for the last 5 years, from age 20-25. (male)  


In this time i've tried around half of the available ADHD medications (list below), every supplement known to man (20+), done 5 years of therapy with multiple therapists and attempted many of the tricks or hacks or productivity systems i've found on the internet, or that have been provided by my therapists.  


To no avail.  


I've always been a very ambitious person, big dreams, big ideas, big plans, people of influence all around me saying I have high potential. These comments coming from teachers, professors, successful entrepreneurs, company executives and so on.  But, I feel like I consistently let these people down. My big dreams, never pan out. My big ideas/big plans, well I never take action on them.  


I feel like I've been fighting with this thing we call ADHD all my life. I never learned how to do some of the most basic things in school, always doing just enough to sneak by. My penmanship? awful, My typing abilities? Nonexistent, my ability to pass a math class? Well I failed calculus 5 times....Even the classes I liked and had passion for, that passion only lasted about a month..... those other 3 months of the semester were spent barely getting by and leaning on what I focused on in the first month to pass.  


I see all these Reddit posts about people saying how the medications have changed their life and so on, and I thought that at first too but then I have consistently fallen off them due to side effects. BTW, I am very happy for all of you who have seen benefits or success in these medications or methods that have not worked for me, that's fantastic, I know what the dark sides of this condition can look like and I'm very happy that you have found a way to manage it or even found a way to get your life back, props to you guys! But, I don't know... over the past few years and even before i knew this was ADHD.... I thought I'd have that day one day where things would work out and things would get better and these feelings and failures would be a thing of the past because I've finally found the way to manage them.... but I am starting to give up hope. The last few days has been the first time ever where I felt like maybe there isn't a light at the end of this dark tunnel, maybe these goals, these plans and these ambitions I have, will simply remain some sort of far-off dream.   


All of these things I want to do with my life, all of these creative ventures i've thought up, all of these things i want to do that I know can help people. I feel like i'm letting these people down, these people that have never met me! Like i know if i just got my shit together that  I could do impactful things in this world, and change things for the better. I can literally see the way, every step.... but for some reason, I just can't do.   


I reached out to my health insurance provider today, just about an hour ago. I have asked for an ADHD-specific councillor, but so far my experience with therapists has been disapointing, this may have something to do with the fact that i am in a somewhat remote area. Specifically Manitoba Canada, with only 1 million people. The likelihood of finding a really good ADHD specialist seems low. But, we shall see.  


Can anyone relate to this? Does anyone else have any suggestions or do you see something i'm missing? I could really use some help here ADHD fam.

Medications tried: Ritalin short and long form, Adderall short and long forms, Vyvanse. All of their side effects became too much. I was taking 1/4 of the lowest dosage of adderall you can get for awhile and still was getting extreme side effects. Making me angry, my skin breaking out, high blood pressure, strange ticks and so on.",1

1483b10,"No migraines, just a numb feeling","I‚Äôve just passed over a month on Vyvanse and upped dosage to 30mg.

I used to get such bad migraines and headaches my whole life‚Ä¶ and I think I‚Äôve only had one the last month. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs miraculously cured them. I read that it can make it worse, and this only ever happened when I was on 20mg which felt like the wrong dose for me. Unsure why this happened but I feel so grateful. On top of that, I‚Äôve been able to work so well, get through my tasks etc. my family are thrilled by how well I‚Äôve been compared to before diagnosis

So far so good, but I‚Äôve been experiencing a sort of numb feeling at the end of the day. My social battery just plummets. Anxiety returns, thoughts come back in, and going out to social events has become harder as I just feel more aware and less able to relax and have fun.

I had one liquor drink the other night and I experienced crazy effects like throwing up, fever, dizzy and hearing was going for a short time. It cleared up pretty quickly but I was just shocked because I had other types of alcohol (wine) before and it was fine with the meds.

The positives greatly outweigh the negatives. I no longer feel the impending feeling of anxiety, overthinking, dwelling on certain events and unable to think straight. This is greatly greatly reduced since diagnosis.

Just wondering how to combat this. Thought about maybe not taking it on days I know I‚Äôm socialising, but I‚Äôm worried about how I‚Äôll be on the day I‚Äôm not taking it as my days feel so much easier with it. I want to be able to go out to parties and be with my friends drinking 

Any advice?",0

14831m9,"Bupropion almost made me crash a car head on but made me happy too, yay I guess?","Is there a second drug to help attention/memory alongside bupropion? (My psychiatrist is a pain and it will take me weeks or months even to get a new one)

Bupropion (or Wellbutrin) made me feel much better regarding depression and anxiety. I feel calmer and content, really. It really worked in these areas...

Problem is, my attention has never been worse! After 2-3 weeks of taking bupropion I have: 


 -> while maintaining my motorcycle, taken my back wheel fully off and back in 6 times because I kept forgetting something every time that no sane person would. An 1 hour job took 4 hours... 


->I have driven a car in the wrong direction, swerving left and right to avoid a front crash and thank all gods I made it to the right side (I never had any remotely similar episode in whole life and I'm 29yo). I simply didn't ""hold"" the information about what was in front of me and went the wrong way fully confident

->I have been really off in conversations, forgetting what I was going to say and what people just said. Any single voice and sound will take me out of my line of thought and hold my attention as I try to work...

I thought at first that it only helped with depression and didn't afffect my ADHD, but I think it made my memory and/or attention much worse to the point of endangering me. I think I'd benefit from some urgent advice. I would like to keep taking bupropion if possible",1
14831lr,Weekend chores hack idea,"I noticed something a while ago and decided to test it out.

So I started planning something to do in the mornings regularly and it‚Äôs definitely helping.

1482o16,I think sleep deprivation has been the ultimate culprit to my unmanageable ADHD,"I have always struggled with bed time. I procrastinate sleep. But after starting a stimulant during covid I believe the loss of sleep has been the real issue all along. 

I felt like my medication was losing its efficacy. I started losing hair, suffered from mood swings, went through horrible bouts of depression....and I think it has all been because I haven't been sleeping. 

I was trying to read an assignment today and couldn't focus for an entire hour. Started feeling down on myself, fell into a massive little pity party where I berate myself and start thinking I'm actually stupid after all. But then I remebered I only sleep 4.5 hours last night. 

And it's been that way for two years. I work retail and my schedule can be a little unpredictable but not by more than an hour or so. 

Just wanted to write this little rant down to see if anyone else has struggled with the same thing. The medication definitely contributed to some insomnia, but I think I've just been procrastinating one of the most important daily rituals and it's been costing me a lot.",1
1482npd,Weird psychiatry appointment. Thoughts?,"Hi all, I just had a weird psychiatry appointment and want to welcome thoughts on it. 

I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult about 4 years ago. Since then, I‚Äôve been on a few different forms of methylphenidate and have landed on Concerta. It‚Äôs been helpful to me.

I saw a different prescriber today than usual because mine had an emergency and is off for a while. I never met this prescriber before. For context, he‚Äôs a PA (and so is my normal prescriber) and not a psychiatrist, just working under one.

It was a strange appointment for multiple reasons, but I‚Äôll only discuss the medication related stuff. He highly encouraged me to not take the Concerta long term because of adverse effects (heart problems and some other stuff I don‚Äôt remember). In response to this, I said ‚Äúwell, I will have ADHD forever.‚Äù

He also encouraged skipping taking the medication on days I‚Äôm not working. I‚Äôve been told not to do this by other providers, and from what I understand from the research, it‚Äôs not recommended to skip days. I told him I still have to drive on days I don‚Äôt work. (I‚Äôm already a space case in the car, we don‚Äôt need to make it worse, lol). 

He basically argued that I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt born with a Concerta deficiency‚Äù so I don‚Äôt need it basically (or something like that). By this point, I was done arguing and was just like ‚Äúokay.‚Äù But this argument sounds totally weird to me because my urologist wouldn‚Äôt tell me I wasn‚Äôt born with a myrbetriq deficiency so I don‚Äôt need that (plus my implant) to manage my overactive bladder, so‚Ä¶.

He seemed to be big into supplements, diet, and exercise. I take some supplements but I don‚Äôt like the idea that they‚Äôre some replacement for medication, and sure, diet and exercise help, but they don‚Äôt manage all the symptoms.

I was wondering what other people‚Äôs thoughts were. And if you‚Äôre knowledgeable in the research on this stuff, I‚Äôd be interested to hear. From the research I‚Äôve done, it seems like long-term stimulant use is actually beneficial, but I‚Äôm not well-versed in that and that‚Äôs the first time anyone‚Äôs said anything about it to me. He also talked about building up a tolerance, which might be a thing, but I don‚Äôt know much about that either. Any thoughts/research/similar experiences would be welcome. Thanks!",266

1481xqu,"Do you have a ""productivity reset"" routine?","For me, productivity is like surfing: I can enjoy the wave while it lasts, but eventually I will crash down and have to catch another wave.

I could never figure out why sometimes I'm super productive while sometimes I may space out for days at a time.

I could never reverse engineer the steps it takes for me to ""reset"" and get back into being productive.

What did it for me this time was to have some ""quiet time"". Turning off distractions for 2 days: social media, friends, talking to partner, etc. A full ""leave me alone"" time. Then I organized my tasks and was back into it.

So my question for you is do you have a ""reset kit"" that you follow when you feel you lost yourself into a doom of feeling overwhelmed and start drifting into procrastination?

1481ov5,ADHD Inattentive and my 7 year old son is showing signs,"So yeah. I‚Äôve been diagnosed ADHD since my early 20s. I stopped taking medication between my mid twenties and late thirties but a few years ago I went through the process and was re diagnosed and I‚Äôve been on adderall since. It helps. 

I had to learn the hard way that I needed to make an effort. I coasted with straight As through middle school. In high school I was smart enough and in enough AP courses to have a good GPA but I ended up quitting college because I wasn‚Äôt showing up to class or studying. 

My life was a little complicated. My dad more or less bailed when I was 12 and my mom raised us alone. We were broke. Discipline was hard to come by. I learned the value of hard work and focus later in life. I‚Äôve done fine. But I wish I had learned those lessons younger. But it‚Äôs hard to say whether or not the medication was the catalyst or emotionally hitting rock bottom when my grandfather died. My son doesn‚Äôt have those types of complications. 

My son is 7 and he reminds me of me. He does well academically and he‚Äôs sharp. When he obsesses over something he focuses hard. But if he‚Äôs only mildly interested in something he‚Äôs allergic to effort or hard work. 

His counselor is already talking about an ADHD diagnosis and medication. He‚Äôs 7. I don‚Äôt really want to go ahead and put him on medication so young. But I worry that if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm somehow shortchanging him and his development.

Of course, I have ADHD, and, while we're on the subject of disorders, I also have type 1 diabetes. To complete the picture, I have a very negative reaction to stress that often spikes my blood sugar.

I'm scared, stressed, and I'm running out of time. To make matters worse, I find that I can't remember how to do things I've done before. Like what is step 1 of anything? Cooking a staple meal, writing an email, applying for a job?

1480yo9,Self sabotage,"Hi all. I‚Äôm going through self sabotage in a way that I‚Äôve never before and would appreciate support, advice to move through it.

I think it might be more than the ADHD (I‚Äôve spent almost every year after being diagnosed, well over a decade ago, denying ADHD is even a thing, or at least that it can‚Äôt be something I have, I just am that stupid, unmotivated or lazy, and it didn‚Äôt help everyone saying you‚Äôre too smart for it üòñüòì, so pardon me as I‚Äôm still grappling with it), it‚Äôs the likely both fear of failure and fear of success. Fear of the unknown, fear of living life with something turning out rather than not, the leaving behind of that narrative. Or maybe it‚Äôs something else I don‚Äôt fully yet understand. It‚Äôs terrifying, exhausting, sad, and infuriating though.
Especially with having had adhd, the negative self talk that comes from our experiences in the past, the not being able to will your mind to do things the way others can, the procrastination and self doubt, it‚Äôs making me feel even more guilty and in turn even more paralyzed in my own non action.

1480k2r,ADHD Medicine Makes Me a Better Person. I Need Someone to Relate to.,"I(19M) have had ADHD my entire life without realizing. I had a very negative outlook on life because of where I'm from. I moved to the US before COVID, graduated and go to college here. Long story short, I got diagnosed with ADHD in November 2022 after failing almost every class I had.

I took Adderall in my first semester of college, before I knew I had ADHD, and it was the first time that I felt in control of my own actions for the 4 hours that it was active. I got depression so bad that it almost killed me in my second semester which drove me to therapy. My therapist recommended I see a doctor about ADHD because of the habits I told her about. The doctor put me on Vyvanse, then a different doctor now has me on Adderall.

I can not only focus on tasks, but I saw somewhere that ADHD can negatively effect emotions, which makes sense because (for example) I have a girlfriend and 2 cats, and one of my cats is super needy and it used to annoy me so much but since I got on medication, I've started to enjoy and accept the neediness (almost as like the little things in life are how enjoyable). 

Due to past trauma, I also had/have a porn addiction which I don't get many urges for anymore (I'm guessing because my dopamine receptors are being stimulated). This plus ADHD made it so hard to simply connect with people through conversation due to overthinking (unless I'm comfortable with them). I don't take my meds every day, I'll usually only use them if I have something I need to do for the day, and I refuse to take them past 3pm because I know they'll mess my sleep pattern up.

**Does anyone else have a similar experience with mood improving?** 

**I'm not scared of getting addicted to my medication but I know that it could be possible, has anyone had experiences with that?**

TLDR: I take adderall for my ADHD and it has allowed me to take control of my life.",2

1480hj7,What service do you wish existed for ADHD that doesn't?,"I know realistically it's probably 'accesssible affordable diagnosis and reliable access to meds' etc.

Me, I work from home and I wish I could pay someone an affordable amount to come to my house in the morning and make me leave the house and go to a library to work. They stay til I actually start on my work.

A daily body double for getting started, if you will.

I just got diagnosed with combined ADHD and was prescribed 15mg Adderall XR as my first medication to try.  I'm a little scared of taking Adderall and asked for something ""less intense,"" but she said we should give it a try since my insurance covers it and it usually works well for people. I told her that I don't love medication and would like to take it as little as possible, and she made me feel better by telling me I don't have to take it everyday like some other medications.

Still, I'm a little nervous as I feel that dosage might be a little high. After some research, I know that some doctors start off with 5-10mg.

1480948,Perfect laundry and dishes routine leveraging one cleaner visit a week,"Arguably got an incredible routine going (M31).

By Friday the cleaner arrives for a couple of hours and she irons and packs away all of the clean laundry I‚Äôve prepared for her during the week. Dishes are a bit more annoying as they are not as easy as throwing in a couple armfuls of clothes but again, having the cleaner come in on Friday is great because you know you can let some dishes accumulate during the week and get away with one packing in, one wash, one unpack cycle before you let this happen.

147zq07,Is BARR adderall the same as TEVA?,"My adderall was switched from Teva to Barr. My pharmacist told me that they only order from TEVA and Sandoz and that TEVA bought out Barr.

I have no motivation, no energy on this Barr medication and it‚Äôs bothering my eyes like drying them out bad. He acted like my side effects were from something else like allergies and that these generics are the same. 
The only reason I got it increased to 20 mg from 15 was because it was wearing off too soon in the afternoon and I would become very tired and fall asleep. I was taking 15 mg TEVA twice daily then before the increase. Honestly I don‚Äôt feel it helping with my adhd like I thought It was supposed to.

147zjyp,Kid on Vyvanse... Early concerns,"Hey guys... Hoping for some support and guidance from some other parents.  

My kid is 6yo and was diagnosed with ADHD earlier this year.  We tried baby doses of Adderall before he turned 6 but he turned into a blubbering mess by the end of the day, hysterical crying and said he didn't know why he was so sad.  We stopped the Adderall and waited until he was 6 to try a new med.  He was put on contempla and it was HORRIBLE.  He was extremely angry and unable to get through his day without extreme aggressive outbursts so we stopped pretty quickly. 

Fast forward to last week, he was started on vyvanse and the first few days were AMAZING with the exception of lack of appetite.  He was able to hold conversations for over a minute, could sit and eat a meal without getting out of his seat 90 times, and was in the BEST mood.  He even told me he liked how nice he was on the medicine.  Then, after the last week, he had the most horrible night.  He was literally screaming, wouldn't interact and would scream if you tried to talk to or soothe him.  We did a half dose the next day and, while he was more manageable during the day without a total fall apart at night, his ADHD symptoms were back to incredibly challenging relatively soon after his first dose.  Today we did half a pill in the morning and half a pill in the afternoon.  He's not falling apart like he did the other night but is insanely moody and feels like we're just tiptoeing around him to make sure things don't escalate.

I don't know if he will gradually get used to vyvanse.  What have you guys done?  He is only on 10mg.  He's very sensitive to meds like I am... We were thinking maybe just start with 5mg for a week then try upping to 7.5 for a week then 10mg.  I will consult his psychiatrist but also would love to hear what other parents have done.  I have undiagnosed ADHD and want to make sure I do right by my little dude as I know how hard it is without meds.  

TIA!",1
147zf7r,"What do you guys do to stay focused during long, semi-interesting talking?","(E.g. meetings, college lectures, documentaries, **tutorial videos**)

The most common things I've seen are doodling and occasionally knitting, but doodling doesn't work for me (if I'm gonna draw, I have to *focus* on drawing) and I gave up knitting a while back (plus, it's rude/unacceptable in many contexts). Fidget toys get a bad reputation and also don't do it for me.

Right now I'm learning to use a new program and watching several hour+-long tutorial videos made by a guy who really likes to ramble and get off on long tangents.

147z5wo,Extreme irritability when driving,"Update: I had therapy today and my therapist said I tend to feel stuck in situations and it makes me panic, even though I am not actually stuck. She said if I wanted to I could pull over and get a coffee or wait until the semi is far enough ahead. She also said I was creating a story in my head that the other driver knew what he was doing when likely he was mindlessly not paying attention. She said I could create a new story where he‚Äôs just jamming along to music or on the phone not realizing or intentionally holding up traffic. It helped me a lot, so I thought I‚Äôd add it in case it helps anyone else too:) 


I now have an almost hour long commute to work and am feeling extremely frustrated with how other people drive. 

For half of my drive home, a semi chose to go exactly the speed limit in the fast lane with the slow lane being filled with semis and cars going slightly under the speed limit. Where I am from, (Midwest United States), it‚Äôs very common for the passing lane to be going about 10-15mph over the speed limit. 

I felt so incredibly frustrated and powerless and I know my feelings are over the top. I just get stuck in my head thinking about how much people don‚Äôt consider or even care about the people around them. The semi was holding up a line of cars that could not get around them but proceeded that way for half an hour. 

Then I stop at a drive thru to get food and once you get close the drive thru splits into two lanes. The line was long enough that people should have just gotten in line behind me, but instead they drive around and cut in where the lane splits into the outside lane. 

I am overwhelmingly frustrated with other peoples obvious lack of caring or consideration for anyone else around them. 

For context, I have sever adhd, mild autism, and C-ptsd.

147y8tv,Trouble recognizing what I need? (stimming),"Disclaimer, I don't have a diagnosis (never gotten to see a professional) but a fat chunk of my immediate family and a reasonable portion of my paternal extended family is diagnosed, and I share the same symptoms/traits of those diagnosed. Pretty confident in saying I have ADHD (or ADD technically), and my family agrees.

Okay, moving on. My question is does anyone else struggle with knowing how to stim effectively?

I'm asking because I recently had the the brilliant revelation that you cannot feel the inside of your veins. I get an uncomfortable sensation around my joints and neck that my brain decided must be clogged arteries- I know it doesn't make sense but I had the thought first as a little kid and just never reevaluated. I had been just chugging a ton of water in an effort to relieve it, but through no brilliance of my own I discovered that moving the body part is much more effective.

I actually don't let myself stim very much because usually when I do I end up agitating myself much more than I initially was, I suspect because it's not working.

I'm also concerned because any effective stimming has also been destructive- hitting my hips, pinching off my skin (not entirely sure if that one's entirely on the add though lol), chewing on the inside of my cheek. All have been (mostly) stopped because my sister told me to stop hurting myself and I was to embarrassed to continue- the cheek thing though, I had to stop because it was affecting how much I could open my mouth.

I do do the leg bounce thing, and use certain music, bit neither of those are always appropriate and I can't always do them as long or as much as needed.

Overall I just have not had a ton of luck with stimming, though it would be very helpful if I could do it successfully.


Any tips on finding a sustainable and not destructive ways to stim? Or another sub to look? Hopefully I got my point across well enough.

Thank you!",1
147y52g,Issues with memory and attention :(,"I've started going to the psychiatrist like 3 months ago, and she prescribed me Concerta 36mg for ADD (Specifically Executive Disfunction, memory malfunctioning and Attention Deficit). With it I noticed I could get rid of the Executive Disfunction for around 8 to 10 hours straight, but medication didn't do anything for the other 2 issues. 

Then the next month she increased the dose to 54mg, and I found I had more energy for the same time interval, still getting rid of the Executive Disfunction, still not doing even a little bit for memory and attention, but this time I had little anxiety spikes during the two months she prescribed me, until our next appointment. 

A week ago I had my last appointment with her so far, and she retired me the medication, because she considered secondary effects (Anxiety and a little random dizziness) were worse than the benefit, in this case just the ED, since I told her I stopped taking the pills for a work interview and the days prior to it, because I didn't want anxiety to betray me during study hours and during the interview itself... 

The thing is, I feel really frustrated because medication didn't did a little bit for my main issue, which is, again, remembering stuff, and maintaining attention to stuff I already remembered... 

Is Concerta the right medication for my issue? Or will I have to live with this problem for life??? :(

147x5x4,What gives you rest?,"I've realized that the most trouble comes from being an unable to find ""rest"". The brain doesn't stop, sleep is affected, and it seems I'm unable to find rest.

What I came to realize, is a parallel with the story of the Arc of Noah. Though the cause is different, I consider two elements: drought and flood. 

A situation of drought isn't healthy, you need some water to survive. Work, social interactions, sport, etc. But at a certain moment a flood can occur, either gradually or suddenly due to traumatic events. And it is at these moments you need an Arc to survive the flood. Without an Arc, you'll drown. 

Though I'm not religious, the story catches me. Because in the Bible God warns Noah of the incoming flood and instructs him to build an Arc. When the flood comes, Noah, his family and the animals on board, survive the flood. 

Noah, I learned recently, is coming from the Hebrew word Noach and actually means ""rest"".

So to summarize the story, with an Arc of Rest, they were able to survive the flood.

My problem is, that I:
A. Don't have anything resembling this Arc (a distraction or the energy to do something which provides rest).
B. Don't recognize the flooding leaving me too late to take rest (or use my Arc so to say, I'm already drowning).

So to put it in this analogy, what is your guy's Arc (what is your go-to, to experience rest/repose), and how do you to signal the (incoming) flood?",2

147wsrl,ADHD caused me to get a monotone voice. How do I fix it?,"Hi,

I (M 20) have a monotone voice. I think it was caused by my ADHD (inattentive) I got diagnosed in December and  have been taking medication since February. I'm currently on 60mg of Vyvanse and it is amazing but it doesn't fix everything.

Because of my ADHD I basically had zero energy to do anything and then ended up getting addicted to short term dopamine releases like vaping, technology, pornography and caffeine and ended up getting depression. I've been making improvements in giving up my addictions and taking back more control and my medication wiped out my depression and I have energy now.

But I've just realised that I have a Monotone voice and need to fix it. When I was in secondary school UK (high school)  aged 15-19. I would get made fun of for sounding like a robot and acting like one too. I kind of just brushed it off even though it did annoy me. Fast forward to the present. I also ended up going on a date last week with a girl I had just started seeing and made a sarcastic joke but she couldn't tell I was being sarcastic. Which flipped a switch in my head. And I realised oh I sound like a robot and all the dots started connecting and I realised I had a monotone voice.

I watched a YouTube video last night of this guy who wanted to fix his monotone voice. He ended up asking his work colleagues what they thought of him when they first met him and they all said that they 'thought he didn't like them' as he came off as uninterested and some said that they though he hated them. And then he proceeded to have a mental break down on camera. I didn't realise how negatively this was/could be affecting my life so I really want to fix it.

After this I've done some research online on how to fix it, with speech therapy being an option which I might take further down the line. But I was looking for any suggestions, advice or information on where I could get started in fixing this.

147g8pt,I don't know what these feelings are,"
So for context I've never been in a ""real"" relationship but a few online. My lack of experience and real feeling of love in my earlier relationships makes me confused about my current feelings. 

So over a year ago I met a great guy who took a few courses at our uni and went back to his hometown soon after. I'm very introverted and really like to stay home. I'm social tho and we got very close during his stay. He was very nice towards me and helped me out when I needed support. I've never had anyone outside of my  family do this for me. I kept everything i ever recieved from him. 

The day he left is one of the most sad days of my life. I got attached to him very easily and although I recently cut contact with him i dream of him very often. I often remember him and pray for him. It hurts everytime because he lives very far away and I know he won't come back. The amount of unusual feeling i felt for him made me break up with my ex. I was scared of becoming a cheater.

 I miss him very much and sometimes when sometimes I see his story i feel like my heart aches. I genuinely don't know what this is. Is this love/crush/obsession? He left almost a year ago and I can't get him out if my head. Im over my ex but not him. I feel like I need to cry.",1

This is going to be SUPER long, sorry to all the people who don't like reading. I kind of just want to rant, so TL;DR: ableism is deeply ingrained in the school system and it causes ""smart"" kids to be overlooked and prevents them from receiving the help they need to be successful in the future, and I still feel like my intelligence should just override my ADHD and it doesn't and it sucks; HELP!! :)

Seriously, last chance to spare yourself the essay and go finish that thing you were supposed to do. No? Okay. I am no longer liable for any time wasted after this point: sign here\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  
I'm seventeen and I just got diagnosed last year. All through elementary and middle school, ADHD was sort of regarded as a ""stupid"" disorder. It seemed like some sort of weird, taboo deficiency exclusive to ""challenged"" kids in the special ed room. When I thought about ADHD, I thought about screaming, violent kids with severe behavioral issues, and the ""dumb"" people who had to do special work in a different room during the ""smart classes"" like math or English. I know this sounds extremely ableist, and it is not reflective of the way that I view disabilities today, but it's the way that disabilities were often discussed when I was a child. I know now that the way that I thought about disabilities (and still sometimes think about my own mental health problems) is the result of deeply-rooted ableism within society and the education system, but it is still a big part of the reason why I didn't think I had the option to get help.  
Anyway, I digress. I wasn't ""dumb."" In the least pretentious way possible, I was actually really, really smart. I could read at two years old. I was reading Hegel by the time I was twelve. I could finish a 2,000-page book in a little over a week. I had tons of hobbies and interests. I liked to build things and play the guitar and read and write take little mechanical doohickeys apart to see how they worked. I could hold ""adult"" discussions with grown-ups and I wrote essays for fun when school was done in the summer. My school was very small, so we didn't have a ""gifted"" class, so I would sometimes get put in a higher grade level class at random times throughout the day (being in grade one in the grade six class is terrible and I feel like I got to experience a free trial of being the brand new class hamster). Not only did I not have access to any sort of extra support, but I got LESS support than everybody else because I was smart. I know this sounds like I'm just sucking my own dick, but I'm not and the fear of sounding like a douchebag is another reason why I have a hard time telling people about this; seriously, what gives me the right to be mad about being smart???  
In grade seven, for lack of a better phrase, shit hit the fan. I had actual homework and projects to do outside of class and other responsibilities and activities to do outside of school. I had never been taught how to manage my time or study for things. I didn't know how to make a test review sheet or balance my personal time with the work I had to get done. I left everything until the very last minute and rushed through assignments HOURS before they were due. I hated the fact that I seemed to have lost the natural ability to just do things, and I hated myself. I had panic attacks all the time (although I didn't know that there was a name for them and I thought I was just malfunctioning or something, so I never told anybody). I was depressed and angry, and I lashed out at people and cut myself. I wanted to kill myself, because if I couldn't be the best at everything, what was the point of even doing anything at all? I know that middle schoolers aren't exactly known for being overly whimsical, but the fact that I thought that it was normal to wish that I would get murdered so I wouldn't have to do it myself and disappoint everybody I knew at eleven years old makes me so angry.  
It got worse when I got to high school. I stopped being a little shit (wound up ditching the brightly dyed fringe too, thankfully!) and lashing out at everybody, and I made some good friends, but nothing got easier. I was still depressed, I had even MORE work to do but still had no idea how to manage my time or stop procrastinating. I would sit down to read a book or screw around with something for ten minutes after school, with the full intention of finishing the four assignments I had been pushing off for weeks immediately afterward, but when I looked at the clock ten minutes later it would be nine o'clock. My report cards always said the same thing: smart, understands material extremely well, needs to put in more effort. My parents were always on my case and teachers were always frustrated with me because I was ""very bright"" but needed to ""stop slacking off."" I wanted to bash my head against the wall. I wanted to crawl into the ground with all of my stuff and be left alone forever (Read Notes from Underground for the first time around this time as well, and it still emotionally kicks me in the balls every time I think about it). I wanted to scream. I wanted to stand on top of the school and yell to anybody who would listen that I wasn't doing it on purpose, that I really did like school and I didn't want to be lazy, but I didn't know how to stop. Still, the thought that I might have ADHD didn't cross my mind: after all, ADHD was a learning disability, but I didn't have a problem learning.  
Plot twist! COVID-19 began during my second semester of grade nine. The thought of getting two weeks off from school was absolutely incredible. I finally had time to figure out what was wrong with me! I could finally fix my problem, the same problem that I had said I was going to fix over Christmas break...and summer break...and on the most recent PA day...and on New Year's Eve. But this time, it was going to be different. This time, I was ACTUALLY going to get my shit together and fix myself, and when I got back to school two weeks later, I was going to be an academic weapon! I was going to be better than an academic weapon, I was going to be an entire arsenal of academic nuclear warheads! I was going to walk into class in two weeks and be prepared to give Einstein and Shakespeare a run for their money! That was...not what happened. Somehow, I managed to get even further behind, and then it was announced that school was going to continue, but remain online. I was losing the academic arms race. Badly. I was about seven overdue assignments short of an academic naval fleet and oh fuck, the British were coming. I was horribly depressed, rotting in my room every day for hours on end, and I was cornered from all sides. I'd had two whole weeks to fix myself, and I didn't do ANYTHING! I wasn't about to surrender that easily, but I just couldn't figure out where I went wrong. By this point, school was almost done, so I cut my losses, pulled back the troops and retreated, and passed with the pity-75% in most of my classes.  
School returned to kind of normal during my second semester of grade 11. I was still struggling, but I had kind of just accepted the fact that I had used up all of my academic prowess at ten years old and I would have to settle for turning in sub-par work at 45% capacity of my actual ability. I figured that I had just lost the supercomputer chip in my brain from elementary school. That was, until a girl in my class mentioned that she had ADHD. We were griping about all of the work we had to finish on the weekend, and she rolled her eyes and said that she was probably going to ""put it off until 8 PM on Sunday and then half-ass it at the last second, because ADHD."" I laughed, but I was taken aback: she mentioned it in such a casual way! She was so comfortable talking OPENLY about having a disability?! She wasn't in the special ed class and she didn't have behavioral issues, and she wasn't stupid. I googled ADHD as soon as I got home. Most of the results were resources targeted at parents of rambunctious little boys.  
Resources for adult ADHD were a bit more helpful. The symptoms described my experience to a T. Impulsiveness, procrastination, recklessness, poor time management, time blindness, poor self-preservation and risk management skills, distractedness, and the list goes on! On top of this, it is extremely common?! 4% of the population has ADHD?? Normal people have it??? Tons of smart and successful people have it?? Super famous historical figures were thought to have had it?? Albert Einstein?? DaVinci??? F. Scott Fitzgerald????? Mozart???? JFK??? I was in shock. ADHD wasn't a ""stupid disorder,"" hell, it wasn't even really a learning issue at all, it was a very common neurological issue that I could get actual help for! I felt like I had just escaped Plato's cave! I felt like I had just noticed the protective sticker on a mirror that I had thought was just really cheap and defective for the past 16 years and finally peeled it off and finally saw my reflection clearly (accompanied by the stupid feeling that comes with not realizing that there is a protective sticker on something and just thinking it looks ugly). At the same time, I was scared. I didn't want to tell my mother for fear of sounding like an attention seeker or like I was just trying to jump on the mental illness bandwagon (the looney bus, if you will). After about a week, I worked up the balls to ask if I could get tested. She called the hospital the next day, and after eight months of waiting, I was diagnosed with ADHD (there was a bunch of things that happened in between, but this is already way too long, so I'll save that for another time).  
It's nice to finally have a diagnosis. I have my grievances with the Canadian healthcare system (long rant for another time), but I am so privileged to have access to free resources. I'm on Vyvanse and it's been pretty helpful, and I'm on a waiting list to see a psychologist (even though the thought of telling somebody that I need help still makes my skin crawl!). I haven't had a panic attack in a long time, and I'm no longer anxious for no reason. Although a diagnosis has definitely helped me understand my situation a bit better, I still struggle. I am working to develop the habits and routines that I wasn't taught how to form as a child, and man, is it ever difficult! I still screw up things that I have no reason to screw up, and I'm still afraid to reach out to people and ask for help for fear of seeming like I am making excuses for my mistakes. I turn in work late and I procrastinate on big assignments. I still have a hard time balancing work and fun (putting hobbies first only work if you actually finish the work on time). I'm still impulsive and reckless, and my mother won't let me drive her car unless I take my meds. I still get that sick feeling in my chest when I have to admit to falling behind in my schoolwork. I still forget to call people back and check my email. I've been perfectly on time to an event a total of around seven times in the entire year and I've lost my phone more times than I can count. That stuff bothers me a bit, but it's manageable. I'm finding new coping mechanisms and different ways of doing things all the time. The little stuff sucks, and it definitely builds up, but it's peanuts. I can deal with the little things.  
It turns out, the worst part of the whole thing is being smart. It sounds ridiculous and stuck-up, but it's the one part of all of this that absolutely fucking kills me. I know what I need to do and I know how to do it. I know what I'm doing wrong, and I know exactly what to do to fix it. I understand everything that I'm learning in school and how to do the work. I pick up on things quickly and I know that I'm perfectly capable of working and studying well. I know that putting in the effort gets me the results I want, but it feels like all of my efforts are wasted on trying to put in effort in the first place. Worst of all, I still feel like I can just fix it. I always feel like if I just try harder, or look at the clock more, or get more sleep, or just focus, I'll be cured. I'm smart, I could give most adults I know a run for their money in a debate, and I know how do to so many things, so why can't I do basic things that I'm perfectly capable of doing? There's absolutely no reason for me to be struggling, so why is everything so hard!? In the least pretentious way possible, it sometimes feels like I got out of Plato's cave only to walk straight into a tiny cage. I get to see things for what they are and understand what life is supposed to look like and know what I'm supposed to do and WANT TO DO IT, but I can't do any of it. Being the class hamster is fun until you realize that you're going to be stuck on the hamster wheel forever, running as fast as you can and still never going anywhere.

147xr8r,Action paralysis and exams,"I don't know if I have ADHD, but I find the symptoms to be so similar that I need to ask for advice. I messed up my academic career despite knowing how to do things and having the knowledge. I will always excel above other students because I have a great eye for visuals and IT. People in my class were always impressed by my work, and as a teammate, I was highly competent.

However, I experienced terrible action paralysis when it came to attending class, taking exams, or working on projects for myself. I am highly competitive when others depend on me or when I have someone to friendly compete with. I enjoy studying and attending class when I can focus my mind on it.

But I suddenly stopped attending lessons without any explanation or other stressors. My studies finished two years ago, and I need to present four final projects, but I wake up terrified of the school calling me and saying that the time has run out. I love my career, but I'm incapable of sitting in front of a computer and doing the work I know I can do.

Has anyone experienced this and/or have any tips?",2
147xqu2,Inattentive ADHD,"I am seeking input from anyone willing to respond but definitely those who have had similar experiences.

My teen is now a senior in high school. We are preparing for college. However, we barely got through this year. There was a lot of outside tutoring and help from me.

Diagnosis is mild to moderate ADHD-PI. IQ reflects low average Working Memory and Processing Speed. Other areas are High Average to Superior. IQ test and other educational testing performed in middle school to determine if my teen had a learning disability because middle school all of a sudden became hard.

Your help. I am trying to help my teen plan for the future...college and majors to review. I'm concerned that my teen will be lost at a 4 year college and community College, for the first  2 years, might be best. My teens executive function skills are almost non-existent. Never(I know never say never) starts an assignment until it's almost due. Has a very difficult time with large multistage projects. Has difficulty with inaction, when unsure. Misses important directions in class, like due dates, but has a 3.0 and takes either AP or Dual enrollment and Honors classes.

I have been calling one College a week to talk to them about their disability services to understand the support they can provide.

For anyone whose high school years looked like this:
1) what type of college did you attend, if any?
2) What was your major?
3) How did you overcome huge deficits in Executive Function?
4) What do you wish your support system would have done differently?
5) What did your support system do right?
6) Anything else you would wish to share.

Finally, my teen is currently not medicated. My teen quit Qelbree and Adderall in February. Just didn't like the feeling. We will consider medication for the fall. It was a very difficult 4th quarter without meds.",3

I had huge problems with focus and concentration ever since I remember. I should have done it much earlier (I'm 2nd year in college now) but recently I decided to finally get diagnosed. Now, I don't know how it looks like in your country, but here first thing you have to do is to go to psychiatrist (and hope they don't say some bullshit like ""adhd doesn't exist in adults"" after waiting a month for a visit) ,then they will send you to a psychologist, which will make a diagnosis, and then you go to psychiatrist again so that they can give you a prescription. So what is my problem? well, now I did the step 1, and got sent to psychologist (I have a visit in few days). I thought everything went well, but when I read what psychiatrist has written on the referral I was quite surprised. there were some questions and anwsers on it he either didn't ask or wrote something which was contrary to what I said. for example: alcohol : I don't drink at all (I do once a month) ;; Anxiety : no ;; Suicidal thoughts/attempts : no ;; (I would say a thing or 2 on these but well) and so on. Am I being paranoid?",1
1478ybn,"support, friendship, and how wrong i have been about it","last year, my english teacher called me aside as everyone was saying their goodbyes and moving to our last period in the last day of school.

i had a b in his class, and he was, in his words, very confused about it. i had sometimes gone off and made beautiful, completely over the mark papers about frankenstein and whatnot, and other times i flat out did not submit simple, 1 paragraph grade-boosters for seemingly no reason. our biggest project was a free for all, write-about-whatever-you'd-like-and-probably-still-get-an-A essay, which I had finished half-way on the first week it was assigned, and then did not touch for 2 months even after i got repeated extensions out of mere kindness. he wanted to know what was going on, wether i simply did not care about my GPA, which, there are students like that, that's completely fine, he reassured me, and i had to go on and explain that no, i did care, i cared a lot, and i couldn't really describe why i did what i did very well, but i had recently been diagnosed with adhd, and i was working on it. i told him that most of all, even if my grade wasn't what i'd like, i had loved every single moment of his class, and i truly did appreciate all he'd done for me. pulling me aside that moment was the greatest reassurance he could have ever given me, and i would work on being better. he smiled at me, told me to go to him anytime i needed help, and sent me off to my final class before the end of sophomore year.

&#x200B;

when i got home i told my dad, feeling pretty excited and just relieved, because, other people thought i was good, and my teacher ended the year knowing i cared. and my dad sent me this sad look, and told me,""there's going to be people who look beyond appearances and are willing to give you a shot, because you have potential, they can tell, but if you keep fucking up even after that, their kindness is going to turn into disappointment, frustration, and they'll stop being so accommodating.""

""want them to keep having that attitude? **give back, then.**""

&#x200B;

i guess that might have sort of stuck with me.

i went on to junior year, and immediately fucked everything up by getting my calc and physics grades down to Fs. i went on to impress both my hum and english teacher with my in-class discussions and commentaries, and then simultaneously not impress them by not turning in almost a single one of my essays.

i went on to have an F in my cs class first quarter, which i transformed into an A after getting medication for the first time ever second quarter and working like i have never known a person could ever work before.

my cs teacher was so fucking impressed. he congratulated me, said i was a 'hero' and told me that if i kept it up next semester he could get me a good rec to offset my shitass gpa. he said to come to him if i struggled again, and he'd be there for me.

all i could really think of was ""*well, there's really no excuses now.*""

&#x200B;

second semester was hellish. i stopped being able to concentrate as well on cs, and i started missing assignments again. i failed my stats class by not turning a single homework in, and refused to both admit i was struggling and drop it after my statistics teacher offered the option to me, concerned about how the workload was affecting me (in my mind, there was no 'valid' workload, cause i remembered spending a shiton of hours i could have used working on statistics mindlessly scrolling through fucking youtube so her argument was rendered invalid). i stopped talking with a friend who i'd had a deep, heart to heart conversation with about my adhd who had offered to help keep me in check and accountable throughout this second semester.

one of my hum teachers told me after i stayed behind talking to him for an entire lunch in class that he could be there to help me, no matter if it was history or anything else, and to not hesitate to come by and sit in his study hours to work on whatever i needed to work on. that he'd support me.

i showed up to one study hour and then wasn't able to get in an assignment we had to do for him the next day. i didn't show up to his study hours again.

&#x200B;

i'm writing this right after sending an apology to my cs teacher, because i wasn't able to submit a rec request on time and i feel ridiculous amounts of guilty about it. in my apology, i made a joke that i didn't want to ask him for more time, but felt my apology (about not being proactive) would be insincere if i did that, so i'd ask him anyways.

it kind of got me thinking. . .

that oh.

i kind of have been doing that for a very long time huh?

&#x200B;

. . .

&#x200B;

so i guess that thing my dad said *really* stuck with me.

i've always been incredibly fucking grateful for the people who are willing to understand my issues and offer help. my friends, my teachers, my parents, a lot of them have been mind-blowing amounts of supportive. but, now that i think about it, i have never actually taken their support at face value.

whenever someone would say something like ""i can help you out"" to me, i'd feel invigorated, completely and utterly grateful, i'd jump at the chance of taking that help and would feel really motivated to 'fix' everything, to finally sort out all my bullshit. 

but then the minute i fucked up again, i turned and ran before i could see their reaction.

i didn't want to be a bother. i was just so incredibly sure that i had disappointed them already.

&#x200B;

and it's not that they ever were. not once did i hear my english teacher mention how i was giving away his chances while he time and time again extended my due data for a paper i never turned in. my hum teacher continued his soft reminders about my missing assignments, and my cs teacher never, not once, turned away a question i had in class, nor outside of it.

&#x200B;

so, as always, it appears i have kind of shot myself in the foot here. wow, what a shocker. anyways,

why did i write a bible about this?

&#x200B;

maybe because i lowk have a physics test i need to study for and really don't want to, maybe because i am trying to put off finishing this statistics project which decides if i fail or pass the class,

but also because maybe there's someone out there who, like me, feels themselves not reaching out to their very willing support zones out of fear of fucking up, leaving them disappointed, and not showing enough improvement for them. to that maybe-there-maybe-not-there entity, let me tell you: STOP! stopstopstop! right there! right now! hold on a sec! cut yourself a little slack!

. . .because this is a ***process***, medication ain't a magical instantaneous solution, and we're all probably gonna have ADHD, well, forever-ish. and while some people might not understand that, lose hope, and leave, there will be some people who will, and are completely and utterly willing to be there for you when you need it.

their help isn't conditional to immediate success, or immediate improvement. immediate success/immediate improvement is pretty much impossible (unless i'm wrong, in which case, tell me, please. like, subscribe, and comment down below). don't try to walk this path alone if you have friends who could be by your side, because, well, they're your friends! they're willing to help,

and we're gonna be walking this path for a loooooooong while.

&#x200B;

small steps, everybody.

1479j6c,Phone addiction and ADHD,"Hello everybody!

I am looking for your advice and any recommendations for combatting phone addiction.

For a while I've been struggling with phone addiction and it greatly affects my productivity and my ability to focus (beyond the usual struggles). I literally have an exam the day after tomorrow and I was on my phone all day today and I'm not proud of it. I got zero studying done, the probelm is bad. I try to focus for a while, use the pomodoro method to study for 40 min blocks, but then my 10 min break turns into an hour if i get on my phone and before I know it the day is gone. And if I put my phone away, I find a way to get distracted on my laptop.
It's not even that I couldn't learn the stuff I have to learn, because I know I have the capabality for it, but my problem is probably twofold: one, my brain has a harder time focusing on things I'm not that interested in vs other instances when i am very interested in what I'm working on. And two, my brain is just so used to consuming content on ig reels (thank God I don't have tiktok or i'd be doomed) or youtube, so regular and proactive tasks like learning feel so much harder than it should actually be.
The easiest solution would be turn of all electronics and just study on paper, but unfortunately my textbooks are all digital and I have to use my laptop for it. I tried website-blocking browser extensions for my laptop and app-blocking apps for my phone to stop me on going on social media, which work to an extent and can be a lifesaver, but I'm looking for any long-term strategies you have tried to fight phone addiction. I really want to live freer and not feel tied to my phone. I could read, write, create anything in the time I spend on my phone. I could use my time so much better.

I'd be really grateful for any advice you can give me! Are there and strategies, tools or changes of perspectives that have helped you? Also feel free to share your own stories with phone addiction, if you want to!

Thank you all in advance!",1
1479k8u,Social Hangover,"33f diagnosed with ADHD (not medicated) and bipolar I disorder (medicated). After months of ‚Äúwe should get togethers‚Äù, my girlfriend and I finally had my friend and her husband over for a little barbecue. They are lovely people, awesome, chill, and excellent guests. It was great. There was no drinking or drug use because myself and my friend‚Äôs husband are both in recovery. They wanted to bring something and in an effort to make them feel useful (because they are so, so polite) I threw it out there that they could bring some dessert. And boy did they ever. 

That was my first mistake. After months of unsuccessful attempts I finally managed to quit sweets in February because well‚Ä¶ I have no effing self-control. With alcohol, drugs, sugar, spending money, up until last year I was even drinking a pot of coffee a day. So once I am able to stop, I don‚Äôt start again.  

But here we are and they have brought a load of baked goods. Everyone is having a great conversation and being an unjudgmental bunch we are pigging out a bit. As common manners I offer to make a pot of coffee. Oops. I suggest decaf because well it‚Äôs 8 at night and they tell me to make caffeinated coffee. Like I said I have gone down to strictly 2 cups of coffee a day with the last one taken no later than 1 pm (doctor‚Äôs orders). As we are all pouring our coffee I decide YOLO, have a cup of caffeinated coffee. And that turns into 2 cups of coffee by the time 9 rolls around, which is my bedtime. 

Guests leave and I am like‚Ä¶ Buzzing. But this night is going to hell. And I can always sleep in on Sunday. So I don‚Äôt take my meds right away and my girlfriend and I turn on the Nintendo and play Tears of the Kingdom which turns into a video game binge until 1 am. Featuring the desserts that I begged our guests to take home (they refused).

I seriously feel like a little kid who can‚Äôt handle any sort of indulgence.

I just feel very less than. 
I was taking Vyvanse and it definitely helped with my focus but it was only for a month roughly before my insurance had to switch and now I‚Äôm working on getting back on it; but even so. It never really made my memory any better.

147d5n8,Recently diagnosed and then a week later moved overseas for 1-2 years. I'm struggling. Help!,"So basically at the end of last year it was made aware to me that all my life struggles could have been due to ADHD. I went and ended up being diagnosed in March. 

A week later I have moved continents and have been travelling to different countries since then. Never in a place longer than a week.

I've noticed that my struggles have worsened severely with the complete removal of routine. New hostel/hotel/BnB/country every few days. Its been to the point I was asking my partner if I maybe have early onset dementia instead of ADHD.

I suppose I have two main (very broad) questions:

1. I moved before I could have a proper talk to the doctor about medications and get started trialling them, initially I thought I would wait until I went back to my own country but these last few months of being extremely unfocussed have been their own kind of hell. Do people really find they help alot? Would it be worth me trying to get a GP (in whichever country I settle in) to work with me with medications? Or is it not worth the hassle of trying to prove to them I have it and then liasing with the original psych, given that the drugs are controlled substances?

The tests were boring and frustrating. When she had me making up stories with random objects, my brain decided now was the perfect time to be a petulant child and not cooperate. No this is dumb! I'm not doing it! You can sit there and look like a moron! Thanks brain. So helpful.

But I got my results in and.... autism? Like I suspected but to see it laid out like that was SO validating. I'm not broken! There's a reason I do what I do!

Just the act of masking and living in society can be so draining.

I joked about how it'd be easier if there was an ADHD retirement community where you can live and work and be our weird wild selves with each other. Where we could have the structure and routine that we need, but have an external structure in place that would support us in a way that works for us, not just trying to fit into the square peg of society. And while obviously, setting up an ADHD commune would be intense, what if we did like an ADHD cruise or something?

People could sign up, it'd be structured with the potential cruise ship events, food and drinks would be inclusive, and we could just hang out and get to know each other and not mask for a few days.

I tried googling to see if there's anything like this already and could only find summer camps for kids with ADHD. But I feel like there need to be resources for adults with ADHD where we can have this structured time together, but without having to worry about running an event. We could even have time where we all talk about our struggles like a support group type thing, have time in nature together, and just chill.

I don't know, it could be fun.",1

I was prescribed Adderall and it's been helping. However, I have been looking at straterra as well because I also have anxiety issues and I've heard it helps with both. I know straterra functions more like an antidepressant than a short term stimulant like Adderall. I have tried straterra in the past. I wasn't exactly ready to fully accept my diagnosis back then and when I had a negative reaction to its side effects I wrote it off and stopped taking it.

147u5pt,How to regain emotional stability after sensory overload?,"I got diagnosed with ADHD 6 months backs and have been on meds since. It has definitely helped bit I have observed a pattern with myself when it comes to sensory overload.

For example, today I went out to have some coffee at a cafe and everything was good. It started raining so I waited it out and left on my cycle. Somehow, I didn‚Äôt take the correct turn on my way back and it started raining again. I was getting wet and already concerned about falling ill, I wore my raincoat but couldn‚Äôt close the zipper. I thought that‚Äôs okay, my arms would be dry. And then on my way the rain became heavy. And then on the signal where I had stopped, someone said that my ‚Äúshoes are gone‚Äù. And that was it, I felt like punching the person who said that. But of course, I kept silent and focused on getting back home.


After I got back home, I was already feeling overloaded, with the traffic noise, the fact that I had gotten wet, my nice sneakers were all dirty now and I was feeling restless, just clenching my teeth. I sat down to have dinner and watch season finale of ted lasso and damn, it disappointed me emotionally. I became totally frustrated! 

That‚Äôs when I realized that I get overloaded with things like riding/driving and the more I get to know that more number of things are going wrong, the more I become demotivated to do anything after coming back home and just feel frustrated.

I got consumed with the idea of listening to maximum new music possible. Made a huge list of where I would search for it, etc. Did I follow up? My result from this is listening to 4 new albums today. Yeeey, what a fucking accomplishment. This took me around 40 min- 1 hour, what about the rest of the day? I was smoking and over eating because of the pressure, "" I NEED TO GO OVER THE LIST BUT ITS SO HARD"". And every day, whenever there is some activity that requires focus and sitting down, I just can't. Eventually every hobby leads to sitting down and learning to improve your skill but I cant. I feel myself missing out on life.

When I meet people, I dont have anything to say. I didn't learn anything new, I didnt get inspired. I have listened to 4 albums that were middle for me, I don't have much to say about them.

It's not okay to think "" even this small accomplishment is an accomplishment"" if it happens EVERY FUCKING DAY. People get depression not from not reaching their goals, but from how long it takes them to reach those. And it takes forever. 

I envy people who can build their life and personality based on their skills and knowledge, their master of their hobby or job, those people who can sit down and learn to become better and better, who dont have a mental break down from trying to start a task so heavy as forcing yourself to press play on a song.

At the moment I am now full on stuck.

I went to my GP and they outright refused to share care.,
I spoke to another local GP, and they will only accept if I go NHS, current wait time is 1-2years.,
I spoke to a Private GP and they refused to share care.,
I spoke to Psychiatry-UK, there‚Äôs a year wait list for titration service.,

So currently my only option is my Psychiatrist, but he can only prescribe up to titration end, as he doesn‚Äôt have the remit/time/resource to prescribe 

So I can‚Äôt start meds.

147td37,Switched to Concerta from Vyvanse,"Hello everyone!  
  
I wanted to give you an update on my medication experience. Today marks the second day since I switched from Vyvanse 60MG to Concerta 54MG. I made the change because Vyvanse's positive effects would only last for less than an hour before fading into anxiety. This forced me to rely on caffeine and nicotine to try and boost its effects. I had been taking Vyvanse for over a year, and initially, the effects were decent, lasting around 2-3 hours. However, after a few months, the positive effects would wear off quickly, as if my body was flushing out the medication and the pro-drug aspects weren't working effectively. It's possible that my high metabolism played a role in this.  
  
So far, my experience with Concerta has been positive. The effects last well over 10 hours, and I even feel a boost after a meal, suggesting that the pill is staying in my stomach and the extended release mechanism is working. Unlike Vyvanse, there isn't a sudden rush of energy in the beginning. Instead, I experience a slow, warm, and relaxing effect. I find that I can pause between thoughts and actions and breathe peacefully.  
  
I just wanted to share my initial experience with Concerta, and if any of you have similar or related experiences, I would love to hear about them.",34

My wife is a healthcare provider who has worked for a small private medical practice for the last 10+ years. The staff has fluctuated between having 1-3 medical providers, 1 business operator, and 1 secretary, so generally about a 4-person business. The current owners (one of the medical providers and the business operator) are retiring and selling my wife and I are buying the business. The plan is for my wife to continue to have a full day of seeing patients and I help with the business management/operations.

Now, it‚Äôs been my dream to be an entrepreneur and build my own business since I was little. I studied Entrepreneurship in college and the only books I like to read are biographies of entrepreneurs, business strategies books, and psychology books (and Tolkien‚Äôs body of work obviously). That said, I am highly interested in the new opportunity of running the business so my wife has a safe and healthy place to continue to do her amazing work. But I am worried that my ADHD might inhibit me from seeing it through successfully through, and am worried I might be a good fit.

Does anyone have any insight as to what it‚Äôs like running a small business with ADHD?",1
147t5v2,Planners/Planner Apps?,"Ok I know how it sounds üòÇ I just got diagnosed with combined type ADHD (which really set me back financially) and I don‚Äôt think I can afford meds. I reallyyyyyy want to stick to a routine and all the apps/methods I‚Äôve used have fallen through once the novelty wears off. I, a) just want to keep sleeping in the morning and then b) want to stay in bed. Once I do manage to get out I never stick to a routine and it frustrates me.

147t55k,How do I learn to drive safely?,"Little bit of background, I‚Äôve been in 3 accidents and genuinely do try to be a good driver. Recently started a new job loading aircraft with pesticides.

I almost fucking killed myself and the pilot today because I forgot to look both ways before crossing an airstrip while the pilot was taking off. I thought he already took off to the east but he came back around west and I forgot to check. He was about 10-20 feet from hitting me. Luckily he was high enough up. 

I‚Äôm sick of this. I don‚Äôt want to fucking kill anyone. I hope this is the right sub. If anyone has had similar problems and can share how they helped to solve it it would be greatly appreciated. I did stop taking my medication recently and public transit isn‚Äôt an option where I live. Still had close calls on my medication but I think it makes me a better driver. Doesn‚Äôt seem to help with much else and makes it so I can‚Äôt sleep at night. Not being able to sleep also makes driving just as bad.

TL;DR how do I stop myself from killing somebody because I‚Äôm too fucking zoned out when I drive.",3
147t0up,Daily planning with ADHD: what do you struggle with the most?,"\*delete if not allowed\*  
Hi everyone, I am looking to design a digital planner that is specifically catered towards individuals with ADHD. I myself am diagnosed with ADHD and find that some planners are just not realistic in terms of goal planning and keeping myself on track.

  
To better help me thoroughly design this planner I would really appreciate it it you answered one (or both) of these questions:

  
\-What factors prevent you most from reaching your goals? (time blindness, forgetfulness, motivation, procrastination)

  
\-If you could design a planner what features would you like it to have?

  
Any other comments or suggestions would be appreciated!",4
147sxqn,I'm losing my hyperfixation.,"It was a really good one. Made me feel accomplished. 

I would spend hours on it but would take regular brain breaks so i wouldn't neglect other things. It was kind of like reddit or other app, where I would close it and then open it like ten minutes later when I got bored. Now I can spend less and less time on it at a time. 

I dont want to lose it. It's been so good and helpful for me. Why does my brain lose interest? I know I could keep it better if I had people to nerd out with it, but I don't know anyone who is into it and the people online are way ahead of me and ugh... I just want my hyperfixation back. My next one is probably gonna suck in comparison.",221
147sww6,Is it unfair I got upset with my dad over laundry?,"My adhd causes A LOT of sensory issues with clothing, since moving into my parents basement suite I‚Äôve started taking care of myself. I do my own laundry, dishes, and keep the place clean. My dad plays his video games in the living room which I don‚Äôt mind, he isn‚Äôt loud and I usually stay in my room. However, a recent issue has come up where I‚Äôve started doing laundry while he‚Äôs playing his games. I‚Äôve come back to find the washer full of sopping wet soapy clothes or the dryer is full of damp half dry clothes. I asked him if he knew anything about it and he said ‚ÄúI stopped them, I don‚Äôt like the sound.‚Äù
I can understand he doesn‚Äôt like the sound but it‚Äôs any time he‚Äôs down there. Even if it‚Äôs been running before he walked into the room. The biggest problem with this is he comes home from work early nearly every day, so when I get home from school I don‚Äôt have enough time to get it washed, dried, and pulled out before he‚Äôs home. He‚Äôs threatening to unplug unless I would ‚Äújust stop being lazy and take your laundry upstairs to wash.‚Äù
I got mad and yelled at him, I shouldn‚Äôt have acted out so strongly but it was extremely upsetting how he was brushing off my feelings because the noise annoyed him. I pointed out how he has another entire computer setup in his bedroom but he never uses it anymore since he‚Äôs always in the basement. His response was that he liked basement better. That‚Äôs it. 
You may be wondering why it‚Äôs such a big deal to wash my clothes upstairs. Like I said, my sensory issues are intense to the point it can lead me to melt down. It sounds dramatic I know. But the reason I began washing my laundry downstairs is because my sister is my size in clothing, she takes my clothes constantly despite my asking of her not to. She claims to look better in my clothes than I do and thinks it‚Äôs reason to steal them. My clothes are specific to my comfort and she has two dressers full of clothes. This may be more of a frustrated rant but it‚Äôs really distressing me. Any advice?",1
147sthr,Different side effects on different forms of methylphenidate?,"Hi everyone, 

I can't remember what my psychiatrist said (thanks ADHD memory!) so looking for people's experiences. 

  
I'm wondering if anyone has tried different forms of the same type of stimulant? (Especially methylphenidate). For example changing between a short, medium or long acting version. Did you experience the same side effects to the same degree or if it was different? 

E.g. If I had chest discomfort on Equasym XL which is medium release (6-8hrs), does that mean I would be likely to get it on a longer acting form like Concerta XL (10-12hrs)?

When I got home for the summer, I started drinking on the weekends, and one thing I‚Äôve noticed, is that drinking while on guanfacine will spike my anxiety for the next 3 days or so, more so than if I wasn‚Äôt on guanfacine.

I do have a loss of appetite and headaches just before my second dose is due. I would like to think I am doing better. My thoughts are still scattered and fast, but maybe not as bad?

I think I have focused better sometimes, and not forgotten as much, but I think with these things it's hard to really measure.

I also have a paranoia of getting sugar pills instead. The pills are sweet, but I guess Adderall is supposed to be sweet. Guess I will never know.",1
147rujd,Graduating cum laude tomorrow and I couldn't help but feel sad.,"I know I sounds ungrateful but.. please hear me out.

I've always been an achiever, and usually perform top of the class. Well in this university, many of my friends and classmates are graduating with magna cum laude and I'm graduating with ""less"" even if I honestly know I could match their abilities. During the pandemic (online classes), I barely listened to classes and procrastinated so much that I crammed whole subjects of study into few hours. Reading was so difficult too as I'm majoring in psychology. I kept rereading sentences and couldn't process them fast enough. 

I was only diagnosed in my last year of undergrad, when I finally realized that my forgetfulness, hyperactivity, and other symptoms my whole life were more than ""just irresponsibility and lack of effort"". In my last term, while on meds, I scored among the top during the exams because I was able to read well and process sentences immediately, and also was able to organize my mind to study the subjects well. Without meds/before diagnosis, I used to be close to last in class sometimes even if I gave just as much effort to study (unless the subject was very interesting)

I can't help but feel.. that I could have done better in my whole 4 years of college. Could I have studied more, been more organized, followed through my own goals if only I knew I had ADHD earlier and taken my meds. Would I have had higher honors/achieved more?

Magna cum laude also would have cut my med school tuition into half, (which would have been great help to ease the burden off my family who isn't rich). Doing my best to stop my tears...

EDIT: Thank you to all who extended good words and support! I feel a lot better thinking I *did* do my best with what I had back then. Thank you for all the congratulatory messages too, you guys are awesome. Also, the point of this post wasn't ""I didn't get magna cum laude, boo hoo life is ruined"", it's ""I was diagnosed with ADHD later so I have what ifs about important things in my life, grieving what life might have been if I was diagnosed earlier."" Some are starting to invalidate feelings but I won't delete this post as everyone's own stories on replies are important too! It might help other people who might be going through the same as me; specifically, someone in the replies said:

""You did the best you could with the tools you had. When you got better tools, you did better. That's victory, not failure. With luck, this pattern will continue.""",483
147s712,Got prescribed straterra and I'm super disappointed lol,She didn't want to prescribe me stimulants because of the shortage and she thinks it can just be anxiety and depression causing my symptoms. I know stretterra can work but it takes months and by the time it does work my current semester will be over and I won't be able to get my grades up. She said she'll think about stimulants if this doesn't work but every pysch says that and it just ends up with me wasting months of my life on a medication that doesn't work.

147s5s8,One of the most annoying things I've been experiencing about ADHD,"Is really has to be the absolute whiplash, mentally. I go from feeling like I'm not worth a sack of rotten potatoes to feeling absolutely high on life and feeling like I can do absolutely anything, and then having that feeling it disappear. Just knowing that it's there makes the downtimes even harder sometimes.

I know this is likely just due to the medication going on and off in my case, but knowing that I could be this person all the time (I mean, who knows, that seems like a bit much for all the time but I hope you know what I mean) Just makes me feel really bummed and feel like I'm missing a lot of potential and opportunities in life to be that person I want to be. Because when the crash comes, it really comes and it's hard to break out of. It's been getting better recently but still happens with enough regularity that I wanted to just get it off my chest here.

147s0gw,Vyvanse stopped working after a few days,"Hello,
I took Vyvanse 30 mg for a few months, recently upped to 40 mg and I feel no difference. I only felt it's effects when I used it the first few days at 30 mg. I'm wondering what I should do about it. Because when stimulants do work for me, they work great. It's a huge bummer when they stop working though, because when they do work I feel like a new man who can finally carry optimism and enthusiasm into the day. I suffer from anhedonia and they also have a great antidepressant effect when they do work. Would love advice, and I'm considering booking a sooner appointment to see my psychiatrist. Thank you.",12
147rzxn,From Struggle to Strength: How My Late-Life ADHD Diagnosis Unleashed My Potential,"I'm writing this post to share a journey that has spanned over three decades of my life. It‚Äôs the story of how I discovered, at the age of 32, that I have ADHD, and how this realization became a turning point in my life, helping me to unlock my full potential and achieve my lifelong dream.

Growing up, I always struggled with motivation and focus, typical characteristics of inattentive type ADHD. As a child, I was tested twice for ADHD, but I managed to mask my way through both assessments. My teachers described me as the 'nutty professor,' my mind a messy desk brimming with ideas but lacking in order. My ADHD wasn't identified because I was able to leverage stress and cortisol to panic-work my way through life. Instead I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and medicated unsuccessfully with SSRI medication.

I struggled immensely in my personal life. Drug use, impulse control issues, legal troubles, and the inability to maintain healthy relationships were just a few of the challenges I faced. Even at work, despite earning a degree in Graphic Design and breaking into my dream career at a product development consultancy, I noticed how my work habits starkly contrasted those of my colleagues. My disorganization and inability to focus were constant hurdles.

The mounting pressures of work led me to a dangerous coping mechanism from my university days - drinking 8-12 cups of coffee daily. This, in turn, led to digestive issues and a visit to the doctor, who, after learning about my excessive coffee consumption, referred me to a psychiatrist for an ADHD assessment. With a wealth of evidence in my childhood report cards, the diagnosis finally came at age 32. The moment I began treatment, it felt like I'd surfaced from underwater.

The impact was almost instantaneous. My career took off, earning me a promotion to a senior role and a salary double than before. I was dubbed the ‚Äòidea factory‚Äô at the company, and finally, I could build and maintain a healthy relationship with the love of my life whom I met at the office. I even overcame my fear and got my driver‚Äôs license at the age of 37!

Getting the diagnosis was the first step. Next came therapy to deal with the trauma and self-esteem issues. I immersed myself in learning more about ADHD, discovering the magic of exercise and its benefits. Audiobooks and podcasts became a wonderful resource, and digital tools like online calendars and smart speakers helped me organize my life. I quit social media, read self-help books on ADHD, and focused on building better habits.

With time, the changes started showing results. I pursued my dream of working at Google, preparing rigorously while continuing as a contract worker at my consultancy. It took nine long months of interviews and team matching processes, and also a fair amount of juggling with other prospective employers, but finally, my dream came true. I relocated from Canada to California and started working in AI at Google, earning an incredible salary and doing what I love every day.

The journey, however, is far from over. Living with ADHD means constantly learning, adapting, and struggling. But the lessons I've learned so far are invaluable. Forgiveness and self-compassion are essential. Small steps lead to significant changes over time. Lean into your interests, find your passion, and chase it relentlessly. Therapy and self-education are as crucial as medication. Remember, life is long, and you always have the chance to reinvent yourself.

It has been a challenging journey, but one that has also been filled with joy, personal growth, and a sense of fulfillment. Now in California, my wife and I are expecting our first child, she's due in the fall. I'm excited for the new adventure of fatherhood, and also strategizing for how I will manage with the new demands that will bring.

I hope sharing my story may help others who are also struggling and remind them that it‚Äôs never too late to turn things around. It's possible to live an 'activated' life, just take it one day at a time.

147ryid,Frustrated with Florida / Pharmacy denial,"Hi - sharing and hoping someone has some insight.

**Background**: Diagnosed in-person with ADHD for over 15 years. In-person Psychiatrist reaffirmed diagnosis a few years ago, as did my GP, also in-person. I've been on Vyvanse for the past 6 years. Moved to FL in 2019 and I see that out-of-state GP every three months. Occasionally I have telemedicine visits with her (such as during COVID). 

I've used Publix this entire time, but just moved to a new city (Tampa area). The new Publix is refusing to fill the prescription because it's out of state and this is specific one is telemedicine (even though previous visits were in person).

**Has anyone navigated this?** I've called multiple pharmacies and they all say they can't fill it, despite me having a verifiable history. The techs all say it's up to ""discretion"" but all give me a heads up the pharmacist will say no because it's out of state. I wrote a message to my doctor, but now I'm wondering if I'm going to be out of meds regardless for a month - because won't the system think I'm getting multiple prescriptions if I try to find a local doctor? 

Added to that - I've run into so many quacks that don't believe adult ADHD is real here - I'm terrified to go to the doctor and have someone that doesn't believe in it invalidate my diagnosis. I understand some people abuse medication, but it's so disheartening to actually need it and be denied. :( ",2

It's too late to get an APL, and I'm not gonna receive my health insurance for another month and a half...

I have a job interview tmw, but i know they won't hire me cause i don't have a health insurance. But I'll have to explain that to my mom, to whom I've been lying the entire year about being done with the paperwork.

I'm so scared of how my dad's gonna react. I know my mom and other family members will lose all respect they had left for me. 

i know this is too big of a mistake, but still, i wish they would forgive me..
i wish going to Uni and getting good grades was enough for them, because they don't even know how bad I'm struggling with depression and, of course, undiagnosed adhd.

147r5p4,"First time on meds, is this normal?","Hey guys, 

So I haven't officialyl gotten an adhd diagnosis yet. I'm intending on going next week. A year ago, a professional did tell me they suspected I had it and I always suspected myself, but just felt uneasy about taking meds. 

Today, I tried concerta from my friend. Now I know I should only take it when it's been prescribed, but I've been really struggling to focus lately. 

The effects were incredible. I had no idea how badly I was suffering prior to this, hence me going to get diagnosed ASAP. 

However, three hours into taking Concerta XR, my tongue became sore. I took it at 9am,and at about 12 by tongue became sore and it felt like the cheeks are kinda swollen. I'm not struggling to breathe or anything, so I don't think it's an allergic reaction. But I'm really not sure. I am a smoker. I have been hydrating all day. I still feel this sore tongue and swollen cheek sensation. Is this normal? What could it be? It kinda feels like when you have too many sour candies and your tongue gets sore on the sides and back",0
147o748,I'm losing myself,"I already posted this on r/RSD, and figured that it might be appropriate for this sub as well, since I learned that it's common for people with ADHD to have it. I have ADD.

I don't know how much of this is RSD and how much it's my actual personality, but I really want to vent and see if there is even 1 person here who can relate. I found out what RSD is a few days ago and had a huge epiphany.

I wasn't like this as a child. I had my hobbies, I had my opinions and I had friends. Pretty normal childhood. As I grew up, something changed. When I entered middle school I started to anticipate rejection. Stopped socialising completely. All my self confidence dissapeared. I still had friends at school that I liked talking to, and would hang out with them if they insisted or it was a special occasion.  But I usually stayed home and didn't feel like I was missing out, cause I loved watching YouTube, reading, playing videogames...and I also loved drawing. I was never bullied, was very average looking and didn't have any reason to think that I was gonna be rejected by my peers. But I still decided to isolate before I could be rejected. 

By the time I entered highschool, something changed again. I didn't just anticipate rejection, I anticipated criticism and judgement on all areas of my life. I still didn't socialise much, only with the one friend I made who was very similar to me. I anticipated every way in which I could stand out and prevented it. I dressed as plainly as I could, jeans and a hoodie or short jeans and t-shirts during summer. I didn't want to bother finding my own fashion sense or the way I want to present to the world, cause I might be criticised and that would be too much. Never shared the music I like for the same reason. The same with most of my hobbies and shows I liked. It felt like it was much easier, painless and comfortable to not have a personality, to seem plain. It wasn't fun, and I wasn't happy, but at least I wasn't experiencing rejection or being laughed at. But...I never had any reason to think that I would be laughed at. So I don't know where those thoughts even came from. It just happened. 

I'm in university now, and things have not improved in the slightest. I have become a perfectionist, and still don't express myself. I don't try new things in fear that I might fail at them and people will know. If I accidentally get in a situation in which I have to try something new or do something I'm bad at, I practice beforehand. It feels like it's better to not try anything new than try and fail. I stopped drawing because of this. I became afraid of showing my drawings to people, in fear of being criticized. I became so hard on myself that it wasn't fun anymore, so I stopped doing it.

I have a partner now, and get along with some people, even though I wouldn't call them friends. I started dating my partner because they asked me out, cause I would have never been brave enough to do it. We love being around eachother, and they do get to see glimpses of my personality (and love them) but they have never seen me be myself. I just show them the parts that I know they like and won't be rejected, even though I know them and have a feeling that they would love most of what they don't know yet. I go along with what they want to do, in all areas. Sex is good, and thankfully I know not to do things I'm not comfortable with. That never happens, I am able to say no and communicate during these situations. However, I know it'd be even better if I were brave enough to admit that I wanna try new things, to suggest new things, to incorporate toys, to explore my kinks and talk about them. But I don't. There is the possibility that they'd say no or find them weird, so I never tell them, and I just go with the flow. It's good and I like  it, but it could be so much better.. I'm missing out on too much. 

 The acquaintances I have haven't become friends because I don't let them get too close... I keep control, so they can't end the friendship. You can't end something that hasn't started. Whenever they say ""oh this show is great"" or ""this videogame is amazing"" I try those things. Whenever my partner suggests watching something, we do. I spend most of my time doing what they suggest we do. They usually ask ""why don't you suggest something?"" And I suggest something that's very popular, or that they mentioned in the past that they wanted to watch. Never something that I genuinely wanna watch. 

I realised all this not long ago, and thanks to my psychologist, and it was a huge shock. I realised that I'm basically wasting my life. I made the decision to slowly start being myself. I made a plan, with baby steps. But I wasn't prepared for what happened. I don't know how to be myself anymore. 

I have been a people pleaser for so long that it's my default mode now, and I don't know how to unlearn it. It's harder to unlearn things than to learn them. I tried to go to the mall and buy myself a piece of clothing that I liked. Something that's a bit out of my comfort zone and shows a bit of who I truly am. But I didn't know how to do that. Every time I looked at something that caught my eye, I would start thinking ""is this too much? Would my partner like it? Would people look at me?"". I didn't want to feel like I failed my first simple task, so I ended up buying something and convincing myself that I loved it, but when I got home and tried it again, looked myself in the mirror and admitted ""I... don't really love this. I actually chose it because I know it's fashionable and I know I'll get compliments if I wear it."" I was kind to myself and tried it again a few days later. The same thing happened. I kept buying things and having to return them not long after cause after thinking about it at home I'd realise the truth. I can't differenciate when things get my eye because I genuinely like them from when I know people will find me pretty (or just acceptable) in them.  decided to give it a break and try with my hobbies. The same thing happened. I would try to look for a show to watch and end up choosing one that I know my partner or acquaintances would be kinda into so we could talk about it. I keep lying to myself and realising a bit later. 

I then tried to write things down before trying to go find them/buy them. Who am I? What do I like? What do I want? Only lies came out. It's like I've hidden my true self so well that I can't even find her.

I know one thing. I don't want this anymore. I want to be free of these feelings and be myself, dress how I want even if it's extravagant, get into hobbies that are only mine, even if nobody else gets them, get back into drawing. I want to be myself, so that I can fully love myself, and when those I love say they love me and my personality, I know it's true, because they know me. I want to be able to make mistakes, and learn from them. I want to stop feeling like I'm living half my life, and like I can't connect with people.

But I can't even buy a piece of clothing without lying to myself. I'm terrified that I won't be able to find myself, that it's to late. I try not to think about this, cause it's my biggest fear right now. 

The weirdest thing is that I can rationalise it. I understand that even if it was very possible that my classmates would have criticised and laughed at me in highschool, I'm an adult now. My classmates are much more mature, and the people around me as well. They don't follow cliques so much anymore, and I see all kinds of people expressing themselves in many ways. I don't even think I'd stand out. I also know that, even if a couple people laughed at me for whatever reason, I could deal with it. Yes, it'd hurt a lot, but I'd be able to deal with it and it'd be worth it in the end, if I get to be myself. I would be okay. I can rationalise it but it's like there's a part of me, very deep within, maybe my inner child or god knows what, that won't let me. I know the truth, but it'll keep screaming at me that I have reasons to be afraid and I have to stay where it's safe. 

I'll keep trying, I'll do research, I'll work more on therapy and I'll do everything I can. I feel very lost but I won't stop trying. I found this subreddit so at least I know I'm not the only one who feels like this...I hope I get to read some success stories. 

Thank you I've you've read all this, it means a lot.

TLDR: I've pretended to be someone else and hidden my personality in order to not be criticised for so long that I have actually forgotten what my true personality is. I don't want to pretend anymore, but it's my default setting now and I can't connect with who I truly am. I'd like to know if anybody relates, and hopefully some success stories.",4
147r04l,What should I be feeling?,"Like many here, I long suspected having ADHD, but only recently (last week) was I officially diagnosed. The doc recommended and prescribed a low dose of generic adderall (5mg) ER to start.

After a few days of being on it, I truly can‚Äôt tell if they are working or not. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to feel being on meds. I know it‚Äôs a low dose, but I know that for some, it‚Äôs the right dose (so you don‚Äôt get the side effects).

What I don‚Äôt feel is a feeling of being laser focused on one thing (whatever I‚Äôm doing). I have read some say that they get this feeling of tunnel vision - I definitely don‚Äôt. I still feel a bit of brain fog, so to me, that makes me feel like the meds aren‚Äôt helping me. But then, after the day is over and I think about my day overall, I start to feel like maybe they are making a difference. Like I got a decent amount of things accomplished, although while in the moment I didn‚Äôt feel locked into what I was doing.

Before anything, let me clarify that **I am not asking if exercise is a full alternative to medication**, only if it does any help at all if you aren't on meds.

For certain reasons, **I am not in a position to recieve meds currently, but I am planning to go on meds in a few years.** Until then, I've been searching for alternatives that can make adhd symptoms a little more bearable...

**I very well understand that exercise cannot fully substitute meds,** but the reason I'm asking this is to know whether it is better to save time not exercising than exercising to no avail, that is, if they don't help even slightly

If it does help , what level of intensity is required and how long. For example, should we run for 15 minutes or 45?

It would be greatly helpful if you shared your positive or negative **experiences regarding exercise** **when you weren't on meds.** Feel free to be frank if exercise didn't do anything for you.",1

147pzra,Best timer apps to remind me to take a break,"Hi there,

God I hope any of this makes sense lol 

I was diagnosed with ADHD about 2 years ago and currently take 30mg XR adderall once a day. 

I have a really hard time moving from task to task, especially at work. I‚Äôm honestly getting burnt out and trying my best to give myself small 5-10min breaks every hour or so to just essentially be a human. Drink water, stand up from my desk, just NOT work. The day goes by so quickly and by the end of my work day, I realize I have barely drank any water or eaten anything and I want to change that. 

I‚Äôve been setting up timers to go off for breaks but with adhd, sometimes I forget to reset them. 

Essentially what happens is I set a timer for 1hr to focus. And then once thats done, I start a 5 min timer to be a human. 

Literally having to get back into my phone and reset the timer is a task that my brain forgets to do and so once I go back into focus mode, I‚Äôll immediately forget to set the timer for an hour and then just work until I realize HOURS have gone by. 

I‚Äôm looking for an iOS app or useful function in Microsoft outlook to help me have a set schedule of timers essentially. 

Basically, I need something where I start a timer for 1 Hr, when it stops it goes right to a 5 min break and then right back into an hour for focus without me having to go in manually and restart the timer.

Like I just need to press it once in the morning to start it and it runs it‚Äôs course without me having to restart through the day. 

Does any of that make sense? Lol does anyone know of any apps or things that they‚Äôve used that would be like this? 

It‚Äôs the problem of remembering to restart my timer thag gets me EVER SINGLE TIME. I have tried so many times to get this right but adhd always wins",2

147phtn,I'm not taken seriously,"So I'm 22m and suspect i have ADHD. I've felt like there's something of about me for many years, but i could never understand why. It wasn't until a bit over two years ago i actually read up on adhd and realized that a lot of it applies to me. The problem is, i did pretty well in school. I was known as the smartest guy in the class and I hardly ever did any homework. In hindsight i have suspected that this made me lazy and I never learned to actually study. 

When I became a teen things got a bit harder, and after a while it felt like my affinity for school vanished. I t was hard for me to finish assignments, any projects that i made was hastily finished the night before, and I spent most of the time in class doing nothing. It felt like my brain stopped working as soon as it got challenging, which in turn made my self-esteem plummet. I had always taken great pride in being called smart, and now it felt like all of it was a lie. 

The problem is that i still did quite well in school despite all of this. My scores weren't perfect, but a bit better than average. My assignments were always completed and so on, and as a result no one knows how hard school was for me, and how mentally taxing it was to constantly worry about the next project  and doubting/cursing myself for my laziness and complete lack of discipline.

All of this culminates in me realizing i may have ADHD. This was some time after i graduated. Last time i took it up with a doctor he quickly asked me how it went in school and when he realized i did decently well he seemed to dismiss that idea immediately. I got discouraged and have sadly not done anything else after that. For some reason he also asked why I want a diagnosis to begin with.

I honestly want to know if there are any other people that may have experienced similar things? It feels like the general idea of ADHD is that you need to be at the brink of failing class in order for a diagnosis to be viable. What can I possibly say to convince others to atleast take a closer look.

Ps: this might seem like humblebrag or like I'm looking down on others, especially those with ADHD, and i just want to say that it's really not my intention.",0

147p9sr,I feel like my ADHD tendencies plus streaming has ruined music for me.,"I have the tendency, as many of us do, to listen to the same artists and songs over and over, sometimes to the point of burning myself out on them. However, there are a few artists that have stood the test of time for me. I would also be forced to listen to whole CDs back in the day, so I‚Äôd find lots of songs I liked by one artist, and I listened to the radio a lot and would find new artists to like there.

Over the past five years, since streaming music has become my exclusive mode of listening to music, I feel like the ADHD tendency of listening to the same things over and over has pigeonholed me. Bad. Spotify gives you your wrap up playlist at the end of the year, and of course it‚Äôs all the songs I most liked so then I end up listening to that on repeat constantly over the next year, and with several years of that cycle, it has had less and less to recommend to me. 

I struggle to have the attention span now to listen to a full album, and my daily mixes on Spotify are all not only the same artists, but the same songs over and over. The result is that I feel so sick of everything, even or maybe especially my favorites, and it‚Äôs even a little anxiety provoking trying to find music to listen to because of this, especially when I play music constantly. I‚Äôm 38 years old and am only just running into this issue, and it seems directly related to my streaming habits. 

I don‚Äôt listen to the radio much anymore but have tried recently because of this issue, but I don‚Äôt connect with much of the new music that‚Äôs on there now. It‚Äôs also hard to get recommendations because it‚Äôs sort of just if I like something, I like it, so my tastes are wildly wide ranging. As an example, my top three favorite artists in order are Rammstein, Alice In Chains, and Taylor Swift. üòÇ

Anyone else? How did you get out of a music rut?",6
147p7av,Why I LOVE waiting mode,"Not the right flair but this is an unpopular opinion I wanted to share.

I thrive during waiting mode and I think ironically it‚Äôs because of adhd? For me it becomes a deadline and I get the feeling I get when a deadline is coming up and I become more focused. (My therapist calls this lighting a fire under my butt and i think appointments do that for me.) So let‚Äôs say I have an appointment at 3 pm then I‚Äôll be like okay so I have to get this thing and this other thing (usually unrelated to the appointment just things I have to do) done before my appointment. And then if I finish those early I turn it into a game of how much can I possibly do before this appointment. It works in a way that time blocking hasn‚Äôt because the appointment is almost a form of outside accountability. The appointment kind of gives a tiny bit of structure to my day where it helps me build structure around it but not too much structure that it‚Äôs annoying and overwhelming. 

I am less productive when I don‚Äôt have some random appointment in the afternoon because it feels like I have the whole day free, no deadlines, I just do everything slow. 

Idk if anyone else has this experience but if you do please share.",2
147p6tq,Do you pretend to know less or be less smart than you are?,"I‚Äôm inattentive type and my wiring is geared for curiosity.

If I wanted to carry on a conversation in my natural way, I would definitely lose most people because they can‚Äôt follow the thread‚Ä¶which I understand. So over the years, I notice that I‚Äôve ‚Äúdumbed‚Äù myself down to have better conversations. I just pick up on something the other person knows about and relate to them based on that.

If asked what I did on the weekend, I will overly simplify so I don‚Äôt end up having to explain why I did this thing or answer questions about why I‚Äôm interested in something.

For example, I‚Äôm an average corporate stooge but I spent a few hours this past weekend studying the philosophy of pleasure and suffering and watching a lecture Kierkegaard. I‚Äôd never mention this. Instead I brought up a trashy tv show I watch.

147p3ik,Any advice for eating?,"I've noticed that since I started my ADHD medication about 2 months ago, my weight has been going down quite quickly simply due to the fact I don't eat (obviously ahaha). I'm honestly not sure how big of a deal it is but I've lost about 8KG in a little over a month. A big issue though is I only weigh 62KG now with my BMI being on the verge of meaning I'm underweight. My Doctor mentioned to me that if I do become underweight, they'll have to stop giving me medication... which I really don't want.

I have to force myself to eat food which is horrible when I really don't want to eat at the time.

147ooq3,Best practices to stay focused at work? /with a rant,"Long story short, I have struggles staying focused while at work.

I work in finance.  Over 3 years ago I started in finance working at a bank.  I have a likeable and put together personality and have always done well presenting myself to managers.  I eventually became a financial advisor early last year which increased my work load and sales targets substantially- something I thought I should‚Äôve been able to handle.

But I couldn‚Äôt.  I would sit in my office day in day out and be distracted.  No matter how hard I tried to focus I couldn‚Äôt work on my files.  I was still able to tackle smaller jobs but when it came to the files that would take 3+ hours i struggled to start them, and they began to stack up.  I started listening to upbeat music on the way to work and really tell myself today would be the day I‚Äôm going to crush it.  I tried listening to motivating podcasts and speeches.  None of it worked.  

Earlier this year, a girl I went to college with asked me if I‚Äôd be interested in a career change.  I told her i would be open to hearing out something but the situation I was in (salary and benefits wise) was quite good.  She told me her father was hiring for a government position in finance.  Sounds good enough to me.  I heard him out and everything fell into place.  More money, better pension.  I saw it also as a fresh start.  Somewhere with no sales targets, less stress, and a better environment to bring more out of me.  Leaving the bank really left my peers in a terrible spot, and I knew it.  It made me feel anxious that I left files for my colleagues to clean up, as they were behind.

I knew I had to do what‚Äôs best for me and I did.  I‚Äôm 3 months in now, but I‚Äôm still struggling on focus.  I am easily distracted.  I use my phone far too much.  I know my job and am good at my job, but I am unable to do my job.  Can anyone relate to this?",3

147oluj,Trying to create a plan to help with my distractibility/focus. Any advice/Suggestions welcome.,"So, i was diagnosed with ADHD in December and have been titrating with different medications since. 

I'm currently on Elvanse 60mg, which i feel like is helping me in areas such as impulsivity, and being able to think straight without a thousand things going on at once in my mind, but unfortunately the distractibility and lack of focus is still there (i work from home remotely which probably doesn't help but i booked today off to relax and try and figure out a plan to help myself because i know medication isn't the magic answer even though it does help)   


I was taking atomoxetine before elvanse which i feel like wasn't have any impact, but only afterwards in hindsight could I see that it was helping me with my focus etc, i was getting a lot of studying done for a certification I want to pass when i was taking it and now it's hard for me to do it without losing focus easily, so my Dr and I have agreed that i will continue taking Elvanse 60mg because i'm not having any negative side effects, and I'm also going to be taking atomoxetine 18mg in combination with it and seeing how it goes, he's giving me 18mg and 25mg tabs so i can test how they work with me.   


Anyway, apologies for the wall of text, just needed to pre-face it with some context.   


Now I'm trying to get some sort of plan in place for myself that will help me focus during work, because there's one thing that has always helped me focus, which is TIME RUNNING OUT, i did all of my university essays, and my dissertation like a week before they were due and tell people ""i work better under pressure"" and didn't realise that was something related to ADHD and my ADHD, so with that there are a few things i want to do.   


1. Leave my phone in another room on Do not disturb (with it set to only ring if specific people/numbers ring, my gf, nursery etc)  
With this one I'm also considering buying a cheap dumb phone that i can keep with me and people know thats a number to ring me incase of an emergency   

2. Installing a chrome extension that blocks websites completely/after a certain amount of usage, because i don't want to just block them out completely and go cold turkey as that might not work so if say i set reddit so i can only use it for 45minutes, once that's done the website is blocked until the next day.   

3. Going to start asking my manager/team leader to set me fair but tight deadlines for tasks that i need to complete, as with me i will always leave it until the very last moment that i know i could probably get it finished by and end up procrastinating until then (my manager and colleagues all know i have ADHD already)   

4. Looking for a therapist/Psychotherapist/ADHD Coach to help me with this too, but that cost's ¬£¬£¬£¬£ and i will have this expendable income once i paid my debts off (almost finished with one which will free up a big chunk) also been considering trying to get all of my debts onto one card that has 0% interest for a set amount of months then transferring it to another 0% card to try and get it paid quicker/less interest.   


But if anyone else has any other suggestions, or books, or material i can view that will help me with this, it would be greatly appreciated, or even tell me your story/plan if you've done something similar to this.

Thanks in advance <3

147ogzw,What are your strategies to fight the lack of motivation when it comes to walking/exercise?,"So I struggle big time with getting motivated and initiating tasks. But one thing I am currently hating the most is that I cannot seem to bring myself to go for a walk when it has no reason that interests me. My boyfriend goes for a walk every evening just for fun and he keeps hoping I could go with him, but I just cannot sum up any motivation to go ""just"" for a walk. If it is to buy something, or even to just look at something in the store, I will go immediately, but to go without any goal and destination makes my brain launch a mega counter offensive againts me. 

So I wonder what tricks have you tried, and which did work for you?",3
147ocgr,Is there a way to snap out of it?,"I may struggle to explain what I mean because it‚Äôs vague to me and hard to put into words‚Äîhere goes my attempt.

  
A lot of times when I‚Äôm doing something impulsive, counterproductive, antisocial, or otherwise off-task, I am aware of it but unable to stop. As in, I know I shouldn't be doing it or I know I should be doing something else, but it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs someone else driving. I can't get off the ride.

  
There is nothing I can do to snap out of it. It's exactly the way people describe sleep paralysis without the fear. I feel like a zombie, mindlessly performing tasks that are not aligned with my goals. I can't identify with time blindness, per se, because I have a clock right in front of me and while I have things I need to do, I can't do them. I'm scrolling, or even doing chores. I find myself in the gym again--this was supposed to be a rest day, but I can't rest, I have too much energy right now!  
Inevitably, it's cognitive tasks that I am avoiding. The distractions seep in and I know I'm just dodging progress toward my goal, but trying to get on task is like trying to steer a giant ship with a teaspoon for a rudder and baby jelly arms. Like when you wake up in the morning and try to squeeze something right away, no matter how hard you try, it's weak. I'm always weak to get out of distractions especially if it is something that needs to be done--there are countless things that need to be done, so they're easier to justify.

  
I wanted to start doing something called ""implementation intentions."" It's a thing in psychology, where you list the behaviors you know are going to come up to prevent your progress toward a goal. So you say, ""If situation X arises, then I will perform response Y"". You make a bunch of these ""If ‚Üí Then"" scenarios and the unwelcome situations become the trigger for helpful behaviors.  
You can see how being aware but unable to snap out of it, would be the single worst situation one could encounter when using implementation intentions. And no one talks about it.

  
I am hoping there are some who understand what it's like, or even what I'm trying to say, and have found ways to get out of it. Do you have any methods or strategies to wake up from the neverending daydream? Any suggestions for either snapping out of it or implementation intentions for people with ADHD would be greatly appreciated.",4

Last night we got into an argument that endedijn her telling me that we weren't friends becausee I am not a good friend to her.   

She used the example from a month ago of her telling me about getting a prescription. I said, in passing, that I hoped she was able to get her script filled becauet I was having trouble getting mine,which prompted her to ask me about my script and making the Congo about me. Later on the conversation (or later that day), we came back to her script and what she hoped it would help with. I thought everything was fine.  

Since then, she hasn't talked much about her meds or therapy at all except for one or two word answers about how things are going. I thought she didnt want to talk about it because it was private, but I learned last night that she wasn't talking about it because I made that first interaction about myself.   

I'm trying so hard to learn better social skills and to know what ways she prefers to communicate. I'm also struggling with symptoms due to last of consistent med availability. And I'm trying to work through my own childhood trauma and SA and how all three of these things plus my general white male narcissistic privilege is fucking up this and all of my other relationships.

Well this month is now up, and I‚Äôm still not noticing much of a change at all. I even took the last week off the meds to see if I could notice anything, and I cannot. Is this normal?

147l84b,Anyone knows what adhd meds do to non-adhd people exactly?,"I heard a lot about ADHD meds abuse for performance enhancing. Where I live Adderall is illegal, so most of ADHD people take Concerta. But its still very frequently abused drug for many reasons, e.g. to lose weight, be better at school or college entrance exams and even for e-sports.

I(female, 31) was diagnosed with ADHD pretty recently, few month after my 30th birthday. I got really curious about what the effect of the meds would be‚Ä¶..to non-Adhd people. cuz I am still not sure I have ADHD even though I get a lot of benefit from my med, even though my doctor is really trustworthy. 

I still think I found comfort with med and diagnose not because I have ADHD but because I‚Äôm lazy and malfunctioning human being who found somehow very convenient excuse and maybe my med(concerta) is just effective to almost every human beings. (This is my asian self shaming talking) 

But my insecurity is not the main point about this thread - I got genuinely so curious about the effect on non-ADHD people so I googled a lot about it both in my first language and english etc etc. also asked about it to my doc.

He said people who say they got better with adhd meds probably had adhd related symptoms that could be diagnosed as adhd. But then why so many people are so eager to use the meds? And why it is one of the so widely abused med?

If there‚Äôs any non-Adhd people who regularly use Adhd meds, I really want to ask how does it feels like. How is it? Whats ur thought about these meds?

147kwjv,Can ADHD worsen? Something more than just ADHD?,"I've always been a forgetful person in the sense that I would forget things that I watched or read after a few months or weeks at worst, but recently I've been forgetting things that I had just watched and read, like the instant after watching them if you had asked me what I had just watched I would barely be able to tell you if anything even stuck with me.

I've always had difficulty studying, used to have private tutor that would teach me things like math and I would just fall asleep, I study better when I actively try to figure things out myself but now even that I can't do anymore, nothing seems to stick at all.  I feel like as I'm reading, as I'm listening, I could understand what's being said but when then it moves to a different topic I would just forget about the previous topic. I also have bad episodic memory or the thing that you would use to ""imagine"" and ""picture"" things in your head. I can imagine and picture things but am not really fully in control of them and they're not vivid, and when they're memories, they show up as dimly lit flashes, and most of the time nowadays it's so hard to make them show up at all, I just keep drawing blanks.

I feel like it's never been this bad, never. I used to at the very least be able to remember the things I read and watched and learned for some time before forgetting them but since mid last year or maybe since early this year, It's like nothing even gets in at all.

I've also been having problems with seemingly not enjoying anything anymore even the things that I used to enjoy or used to use as a coping mechanism for my depression. Every time I watch an entertaining YouTube video I am reactionless, I am paying attention, at least I think I do, but, again, if you had asked me what was going on and what was it that I watched I don't think I'd be able to explain to you much, if any. The same thing with video games and even mangas or comic books. When I play video games It's as if I'm just clicking buttons, I'm not thinking, not realizing that I'm not thinking, not caring about victories or defeats, not paying attention to the story, uninterested. And when I read comic books or mangas I seem to lose track of what's going on and even forget the names of the characters or what happened in the previous chapters, again, as if nothing even stuck with me.

My father has bipolar and my grandmother has schizophrenia. I'm meeting a psychiatrist that referred me to a psychologist and I'm meeting the psychologist again on Wednesday, she made me do a psych test and I'm not sure if that was enough to gauge what my issues are. There's another test that she told me she could make me take to see how my cognitive abilities currently are, which they are currently terrible, but the fee for these tests aren't insured and I don't think I can take any more tests if I need to pay for them.

I've been having problems with remembering simple words, I can't remember when I did what, confidently anymore. My memories seem like a blur. I can't be certain of when ""what"" happened.

Is this really something that's possible to be entirely caused by ADHD? How can it change so drastically and start worsening so rapidly? I'm currently also physically Ill and I'm getting checkups for that too. I had a brain MRI and the neurologist said he doesn't see anything wrong, which is why he referred me to the psychiatrist.

Is it not possible that something that is physical is causing these issues? I can't wrap my head around how ADHD can just suddenly worsen. I've always had symptoms of ADHD but never bothered much with it since I could find ways to cope with it, with studying I would just make myself engaged to what I'm studying, but now it's not possible anymore and I don't know how It's possible that something like ADHD worsens.

My head has always been just thoughts that aren't mind unless I flood it with something so that It can't even show up anymore. It's just intrusive thoughts and it's my thoughts only when I think of something and it's always been this way but lately, I feel like, It's worsening.

I forget where I put things every day now, it used to just be once in a while. I lose my track of thought so often and forget what I was thinking, this had always happened but usually, I would be able to remember it again instantly, now I sometimes just forget it altogether and can't recall it.

I don't know if all of these are the cause of my cognitive decline or if they are caused by my cognitive decline.

My doctors are, government-insured doctors, which they are quite unreliable and they're all I can get. I'm not from the USA and where I live, mental Illnesses aren't dealt with as seriously as they should be, I live in the Capital and I can count the mental hospitals with my hands. And since I'm a man, it's even harder for me to get mental help even from people around me. Which Is why I never really said anything to anyone about my ADHD symptoms, since I could find ways to cope with it. Or my depression, or my addiction, or anything about myself really. There just has never been anyone for me to vent to, for anything. I don't know if that adds to my issues. I feel detached, like I'm in a state of a dream even though I know that this is reality.  And I was about to type more about something but then I lost my train of thought and I forgot and now It's gone, so.

I don't know if it's because of my addiction, I've been clean of it for almost a month now, urges are still there but last year I was clean for almost a month too and I wasn't like this at all. I was like this when I was addicted and I'm still like this now.  I don't think my cognition has ever been this bad.",4

She also struggles to focus when it comes time to study and commit energy to her assignments. I know ADHD can hyperfocus but they cannot choose what they hyperfocus on. Just last night she stayed up till 4 am staring at her laptop screen trying to write her assignment. I think she only ended up writing \~200 odd words.  

I am very aware I am neurotypical and am careful to suggest things (*what about a diary? That'd keep you organised*), but every time she asks me for help or asks me for suggestions on what she can do better, the only things that come to mind are suggestions are things that neurotypicals don't have issues with (*ie better awareness of time, better self-control to be able to focus etc*)

Don't crucify me tho, I am very self-aware and want to do everything I can to create an ADHD-friendly environment around her to help her achieve better outcomes for herself in her life. 

I love her heaps and it breaks my heart seeing her go through this self-induced stress of deadlines for her assignments.

Has anyone experienced this before, and does anyone have any suggestions we can try? 

I really hate seeing her like this. Breaks my heart every time.",30
147k7j0,"how do i leave the insanely stressful ""waiting mode""?","tl;dr: i'm in 3rd semester of a masters programm and i am stuck in waiting mode. i have a shit ton to do but instead of doing it i have been stressed for weeks now knowing i should be doing stuff but for the love of life i just seem to be able to - how can i get unstuck?

-------

hey everyone :)

30m here, first diagnosed at 10, people kind of forgot about it, had a pretty shitty life until i was about 26 because i was raw dogging life without knowing i had ADHD

got my second diagnosis at 26, have finally begun to understand myself better, have been medicated for 4 years and my life is generally the best it has ever been

STILL it's very hard of course and i constantly have to walk through what feels like 5 feet of honey

i have a specific question though:

how do i leave waiting mode?
i am in my 3rd semester of a masters programm and so far it has been going well BUT once again i find myself being permanently stressed because i KNOW i should be doing stuff right now in order to make it and to not have to pull 4 weeks of all-nighters

yet again i'm doing nothing. like yeah i'm doing stuff but not what i am supposed to do. and i REALLY need to get going but god damn all i am able to do is talk about that i should be doing stuff instead of actually doing it

and before i know it i'll be caught up in this tornado of deadlines again, somehow making it through but loosing 10 years of life-energy 

i'd like to change that

now has anybody here figured out to get out of waiting mode? or should i just come to terms with me just working like this? trying to come to peace with me being a sprinter and not a marathon runner?",3
147k42e,Adhd and being a business owner!,I like to think of myself as successful. I am a 37 soon to be 38 year old woman. Turn 38 in July. Anyway I am adhd combined type have generalized anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder. My alcoholism is in long term remission. My GAD is well controlled abs my adhd is as well. I am also a therapist. I also run my own business. Which being adhd isn‚Äôt always fun. I would have piles of stuff everywhere have no idea about taxes. I make a lot of money. So I finally caved and hired people. I hired an accountant for my business she makes sure all my taxes are paid and helped me get deductions for my taxes as well as helped me with an SBL. Small business loan to get more equipment better printer stuff like that. I also do direct deposit with all of my insurance reimbursements. So much easier than hav in a check sitting on my desk.,1
147k3nr,"Vyvanse worked on day 1. But on days 2, 3 and 4, I‚Äôve felt nothing","My psychiatrist started me off on 30mg. 

The first day (Friday) I really felt pretty good. I had it in the morning with a big breakfast (eggs and bacon on toast) and I remember it kicked in halfway through a university lecture. I felt mild euphoria which sort of abated but I was very concentrated in the library for the rest of the day. Then it wore off.

The next day I took it but I was pretty hungover from the night before, woke up late, and didn‚Äôt eat properly. I had Greek yogurt and cereal. I didn‚Äôt feel the medication take effect at all that day, and I attributed it to my poor eating. 

Yesterday I had another decent protein-filled breakfast and was sure the medication would work but I felt absolutely nothing. 

Today I had eggs for breakfast and I still feel quite normal, as though it‚Äôs not really doing anything. No intense concentration like the first day or anything like that. I don‚Äôt feel bad or anxious, just totally normal, like I always feel. Not productive or motivated. So the first day I felt the effects and it was great, but ever since then I haven‚Äôt really felt anything. 

Naughty of me, but I took a second tablet at 3:30pm (so I‚Äôve had 60mg today). I was just really desperate and curious to see what would happen. Well it‚Äôs almost 8pm and I feel like my usual, ADHD self. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll even have trouble sleeping tonight. This is actually bizarre?

My psychiatrist told me to email him on day 4 (today) and let him know how I‚Äôm going, so I‚Äôve basically copied and pasted that into this post‚Ä¶

I can‚Äôt be bothered finishing this bottle and then getting a repeat if it‚Äôs doing f*ck all. Like what‚Äôs the point. I‚Äôm not seeing my psychiatrist again until mid-August. I know the whole thing is trial and error but I‚Äôm honestly just gobsmacked that these meds aren‚Äôt doing anything for me, even today with the ‚Äútop up‚Äù. I‚Äôm tempted to tell him about the 60mg in a few days under the guise of ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù forgetting I‚Äôd already taken the meds once. 

Part of me is tempted to do it again tomorrow morning. I have a lot of study to do and need to spend all day in the library tomorrow‚Ä¶",4

147jj93,Can't handle Uni,"So I recently got into University. Yay...

(TL;DR at the end)

Money has been quite tight for me and my family, but my mother figured out a way for us to get more. I had to enrol in Uni and then I could apply to get money from the government as I couldn't work while studying. 

Now, I knew she was thinking of this but I didn't know it had been decided because I was worried Uni would be too much for me. I kept getting these phone calls but finally answered despite thinking it was a scammer. Turned out it was the Uni asking about whether I actually wanted to apply. Unfortunately I was on speaker and my mother overheard and basically told me to say yes. 

I ended up enrolling and I started about 2 weeks ago. Already, it's too much. I'm panicking and I've barely started. I didn't want to do this. I'm a young adult and now I've got 5k in debt, and more to acquire the longer I stay. I feel trapped. I feel like I didn't get a say but I did, I just didn't have the guts to voice it out loud. 

I want to pull out. I get 3 weeks from the start date to pull out and get a refund; But if I don't and I pull out after those 3 weeks, then my money is gone. I only have a week left to decide. 

I feel like I can't say or do anything. I sort of want to do this course because it's something I'm interested in but I honestly don't think I can do it. I feel like I can't tell my parents I want to pull out because they've already told everyone that I got into University and so I'll be a disappointment and I'll embarrass not only them, but myself too.

If anyone has any ideas or tips, please tell me. I'm so stressed.

.

TL;DR - Got into Uni sort of unwillingly and want to pull out because it's too much but I'll disappoint and embarrass my parents (and myself)",2
147jj0w,UK Peeps: Are there online GPs that accept shared care agreements with Psychiatry UK?,"Unfortunately my GP has rejected the shared care agreement because she says the local CCG only allows GPs to prescribe stimulants for NHS mental health team patients. I know online GPs have become a bit of a thing and I was wondering if I could sign up with one of these to get my shared care agreement. (I know PUK say they can continue prescribing but I want to keep my options as wide open as possible.)

Failing that, I'm in North East London so if your GP has accepted a shared care agreement I'd appreciate a PM so I know where to move when my tenancy is up :)

Any help would be much appreciated. Cheers!",2
147jfeh,I just can't recognise the importance of my medicine no matter how much it helps,"Yeah I know it's the Reddit blackout but ADHD sleeps for no man or mod. 

It's so crazy to me that seemingly no matter how many times I am in a slump and being unproductive, I refuse to take my meds because "" I don't really need them right now"" and do nothing. And then I take my meds and suddenly everything works better and everything starts coming together. 

It feels like I keep laying in bed complaining about how dark my room is while simultaneously refusing to open the curtains. It doesn't seem to matter how many mornings I open the curtains and my room lights up because the next morning I can't seem to comprehend that connection. 

It's not the end of the world and it's mostly just a annoying observation as I try and get into routines where I take my meds regardless but still. I guess just another casualty of my inability to recognise the connections between positive things in my life. I go for a run feel fantastic and then the next day I can't fathom how going for a run would make me feel better",3
147jchi,Atomoxetine nausea,"Hello everyone,

I have been taking atomoxetine for quite some time now. My doctor has been slowly upping my dosage from 40mg to 80mg. 

I have been struggling with feeling nauseous after taking my medication so he decided to go slow and add the 60mg inbetween. I felt great with this dosage. Most importantly no nausea. 

But after upping the dosage to 80mg (which is the final amount I have to take) the worst came. An hour after taking the meds I had to go and be sick since the nausea was too much. Told my doc and we are going back to the 60mg. 

Did anyone experience this too with this medication? 
Should I maybe ask for something else?

147iqxl,I begin looking for one app and end up downloading 70,"Guys. I am sure you know what it's like - you go to the app store to find an app that might make your ADHD life a bit easier. You see an app. Great, let's check it out. Then, below,  you see the list of recommendations of apps that have nothing to do with your original search. 

Result? I end up downloading 10 apps from different categories such as how to budget to how to code (still haven't got started on becoming a Python expert). 

So, I have millions of apps on my phone now and thought it might be best to see what you guys think. 

(I need an app for the following categories. I can only use Google Play, so any ""Apple"" only apps won't work. )

1. Budgeting ( I need to learn to budget. The problem, I have realized, isn't with my job. The problem is that I buy things I don't need or subscribe and never use the service)

2. Productivity ( I guess this includes habits. I'm not exactly sure where to draw the line between habits/ productivity/ note taking, etc, so I often download many different apps and I'd rather not lose my money that way anymore)

3. Journaling (I find journaling to be very therapeutic. I used to be a pen and paper guy. However, given that Google allows you to sync and backup everything, it would be great to have access to an on-line app anywhere and anytime). 

This sub (contrary to the essence of ADD) used to have a massive word limit. Not sure if it still does. So, I'll fill out this post a tad more. Sorry. 

I use Tick Tick as a ""to do"" list and find it great.
I use Google Keep to store important thoughts.
I don't see anything better than Tick Tick, although Keep is similar.

But for the 3 categories I listed, if you guys have any significant experience and could suggest one to me, please do. If there is a common denominator, maybe I'll just use that then - ""say YNAB"" for budgeting.

147io8n,I really need advice idk what to do,"Ok maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking it but I recently saw a psychiatrist only once to determine if I have adhd, and since I‚Äôm a minor my parent spoke to her first then me, and then both parents + me. Well tmr is my parents and I session, and the psych said she needs to ask them abt how I was as a kid since I had to be inattentive as a kid too. I have so many examples of how I wasn‚Äôt attentive in school but the issue is my parents don‚Äôt know. Once I told them about how I drew in class every single day and couldn‚Äôt pay attention and they yelled at me for so long since they were and still are very strict about grades, being perfect etc. After that day I remember still not paying attention but in front of them I could do work or fake the attentiveness while I was doing homework because of their pressure. I distinctly remember how even at home whenever my mom left for the bathroom or something my ‚Äúfocus‚Äù was gone. 

My parents version of me as a kid is different from mine. Basically idk if the psychiatrist will believe me or my parents or will they get mad/not believe me if I told the psychiatrist that I may have lied a few times or kept it a secret that I wasn‚Äôt focusing??

147htmx,how to deal with pda in messaging,"I, like many others struggler with pathological demand avoidance, or just pda for short. and one of the ways it manifests is with me constantly avoiding messages after getting too overwhelmed to answer them.

147h8ft,Is ADHD and excuse here?,"This is a stress fueled post and I apologise for that in advance. Long because I'm trying to explain enough to be fair.

My 43 year old male partner has ADHD and has been medicated for 8 months. Despite ongoing readjustments there has been a vast improvement in our lives and communication. Within the last 24 hours I've told him I appreciate him and the changes he's making. Now onto the issue. 

A year and a half ago we rescued a great dane from a city centre flat and brought him to live with us in the countryside. We got the dog on the premise that anything could be wrong with him and that the dog is his. I brought a yellow labrador to the relationship and after my older dog died we chose to do this so that the lab wasn't alone and we could rescue a dog in need and give it a dream life.

He does the bare minimum with the dog. He has not trained him. The dog now knows that he doesn't need to listen and either runs away or just won't be caught, acting as if it's some sort of game when he doesn't want to come in. On at least 5 occasions I've reminded (at varying degrees of frustration and volume) that the dog needs to be kept on a lead until he is trained.

Just over a week ago I fulfilled my dream of owning a horse as an adult who can keep it at her house. As it turns out the field is visible from our house (this was unexpected I thought he would be a few miles down the road). I explained fully that a new horse, only a baby at 2 years old, needs to be shown nothing but love, kindness and time to develop into a sound, confident and safe animal. I asked and told him that under no circumstances should the dog be let out off the lead until the animals are properly introduced and both are calm and comfortable. I bought the dog a muzzle to wear when out incase he showed aggression. 

2 days ago he let the great dane out without a lead and he took off down to the field and ran up and down the fence line and spooked the horse. Thankfully he didn't enter the field and the horse was not scared to approach us once we had a hold of the dane and if anything was a superstar in being as unphased as a herd animal being chased by a predator can be. Again I repeated the need for proper training and safety precautions.

This morning he let the dane out again without a lead. (But with the muzzle on). The dane ran off and went into the horses field and chased him, narrowly missing a kick.

I fully think that he can't be bothered walking the dog and chose to put my new horses life at risk instead. When I asked why he let him out without the lead his response was that that's actually the third time he's let the dog out to pee without a lead since he chased the horse the first time. This is a common occurrence when I ask him why he's doing something we have agreed is not acceptable (about anything in our lives not just the dog) he then responds to say he hasn't been doing as agreed at all, as if the fact I didn't know or catch him the first time makes it OK? He lied to my face last week on another matter, and then talks about his ADHD and thinks explaining to me how his brain works excuses avoidance and or dishonesty. He also uses RSD often as his reason as to why he avoids communication when he perceives he's done something wrong or I may want to discuss something serious or important.

Where does ADHD and RSD stop? Should I hear him out on what happened and why he chose to let the dog out without a lead? Are there any valid symptoms that cannot be controlled that explains this behaviour? I know risk taking is a thing, but risking lives even though the risk has been explained and I've taken measures and made plans to protect all involved from harm or conflict?

Ironically I'm so angry that I now want harm and conflict. So guys, symptom? Or fucking prick?

Thanks all

Update/Edit
Thank you everyone. I came here this morning looking for someone to help me explain todays events from an adhd perspective that I could at least try to understand since I wasn't given one by ""the man"". As it turns out, all the comments, the good, the reassuring and the blunt and presumptive all helped me today. At times it kicked in my defense mechanism and I generally don't let that run wild, but sitting with it today has made me realise its not a dog problem, a horse problem or an adhd problem, it the man.

 I am off all this week and will spend every day with the dog and the horse in a peaceful and safe manner and try and reassure both of them that one day we will be roaming the hills together and this will be a bad memory. I've just had the dane out and the plucky pony came right up to the fence, and despite being jumpy and shy he stood and grazed while I reassured and corrected the dane when needed. I've decided that I will take the dane and the responsibility of the animals and the life I'm lucky to have and have planned and fought for and the man can manage his own adhd and symptoms without explaining them to me as an excuse rather than a recognition of how things could be easier for everyone involved. Sometimes you need to see how things affect those you care about and protect to realise what is acceptable and what isn't whether adhd is a factor or not. The dog is more loving anyway. Thanks all",5
147h6ma,Why do some individuals with ADHD struggle academically while others excel?,"The main reason I struggled in school wasn't solely due to my dyslexia; but because I could easily get distracted in class or studying.

During class, I would often find myself drifting off to another dimension, losing focus on whatever was being taught.

Even when I would  learn how to spell a word, it would slip from my memory almost immediately. As a result, I occasionally still misspell words, either due to a lack of effort or simply because I get lost in my own thoughts.

Moreover, I frequently experience a  kind of mental lag where I know how to spell a word, but I struggle to recall its proper spelling.

I am aware that there are individuals with ADHD who excel academically. However, when comparing their abilities to my own struggles throughout the years, it often feels impossible to achieve this  level of f academic performance if you get distracted like me.

This has led me to wonder whether those with ADHD who excel academically face the same level of distraction as other individuals with ADHD who struggle in school. 

Please feel free to share any resources from studies that have focused on how ADHD individuals can experience distraction differently",135

To start, I'm not even sure if I have ADHD, but a lot of these posts directly relate to me so I figured I maybe could reach some type of solution

 I want to go fishing again so badly. I finally got my  wish two years ago in Miami, and I caught a good size tuna. It was everything I had hoped. The water was beautiful, and I actually had to fight to get the fish. 

           For the last two weeks all I've wanted to do is fish. With all the free time I have, I always spend it contemplating what to do, and my mind always comes back to fishing as the single activity that would fulfill me. But neither me or my family are in a good financial situation to go fishing. It's the second thing I've ever found that doesn't make me feel like I'm dragging myself to do it. 

     Usually everything apart from schoolwork makes me feel like I'm wasting time, but I feel like fishing is different from those things. It's frustrating. What do I even do in the situation? It's already frustrating that I feel like I'm wasting all my free time constantly, and it's worse when there's a clear activity that I want to do but can't.",0
147eqfc,What to do instead of writing on my arm?,"So, like a lot of people with adhd, I am constantly flooded with ideas or thoughts of things I need to get done but can only hold them in my head for moments at a time until they vanish. 

So far, the most consistent way to deal with this especially when I am at work, (I work as a bartender at a kava bar) is to keep a pen in my pocket and just jot whatever I need to down on my arm. 

This however isn‚Äôt my favorite solution, (I dont want to always have scattered brain pen ink on my arm) and so I was wondering if any of you find folk had any recommendations for alternatives to this. 

I don‚Äôt like using my phone notes for this as I am sure you can understand, as I still have to make my way through the Lock Screen to the notes app and it is too easy for me to get distracted and it seems to be too much of a task switch for my brain. I was thinking maybe some sort of a note pad attached to a chain that fits in my pocket. 

Using just a normal pocket notebook seems to do okay, it‚Äôs just not as fast as my arm and I end up setting it down random places and not having it the moment I need it. Therefore the wallet chain might do the trick.

But, wanted to post here to see if anybody had any thoughts on this, or experience with solutions to this problem themselves as I am sure it is a common experience among us divergent people.

147ex7u,Free time and ADHD,"I just had 2 weeks off from work and I slipped into this ADHD paralysis, mainly in the second week.

147ewdf,Quitting nicotine,"I have a feeling this wouldn't just relate to those with ADHD. I've only been vaping for a few months - and would do it occasionally while out drinking before that. I basically told myself that once the headspins are gone (I'm 20 don't judge me) that I would stop because it is not worth it at all past that point, but of course that did not work. I started on medication not that long ago and I felt so horrible on my initial dose of 30mg XR Vyvanse (on 50mg now) - and that is when I bought my first vape. I was also pretty burnt out and just beginning my first unpaid, full-time work nursing placement. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, all that is besides the point. For me, trying to quit almost feels impossible. I wonder if anyone else feels this way, because no matter how much I beg to myself to not take that next hit, and no matter how much I feel that I can resist it in that moment, as soon as that urge to vape comes through my thoughts and emotions entirely shift and I no longer care about quitting in the slightest. Of course it is still in the back of my mind and I understand I want to quit, but it's like something takes over and prevents those thoughts and feelings from coming through - there is nothing that is going to stop me from taking this hit.

&#x200B;

And yes, I understand that it is probably normal to feel this way. But with my ADHD, it almost feels like I'm trapped in the addiction already - just waiting for the point in time where I no longer care about quitting and am just another vape addicted 20 year old.",1

Most things seem like chores and excruciatingly painful. I spent 20 years at least thinking I was lazy and messy because I never quite got ahead of being cluttered and unorganized. 

I'm supposed to be pursuing a higher degree but dropped courses again because I can't fathom doing more than one class every couple of months due to the amount of focus I'll need. 

Anyway, the NP did not even bother to hear any of this because of a previous diagnosis of depression and anxiety. I don't even feel depressed right now. She said I won't be diagnosed without neurological testing since I'm an adult. Is this how it's been for a lot of people??",0
147et6z,Help with executive dysfunction - meds dont help,"Hello everyone!  
  
I recently received a diagnosis of ADD was prescribed Vyvanse, While its certainly increased my alertness,  my ability to focus hasn't really improved.

I'm curious to know how others cope with executive dysfunction associated with ADD/ADHD. What strategies do you guys use to stay on track and minimize distractions? 

My biggest issue is with a self-paced online course I'm currently enrolled in. Since it's self paced, I'm having trouble motivating myself to actually get it done. I opted for this method because I work 60 hours a week and the deadlines would not have worked well with my schedule, but having no deadlines is making it really hard to bring myself to do it. I need to get this course done over the summer so I can take the next course in the sequence this fall, and I can only submit 3 assignments per week so if I continue to procrastinate, I might have to drop the fall class (which would derail my college course plan). Help or advice?",1

I used to take intuniv 4mg, but it made me feel like a spinning brick with no noticeable upsides so I switched. However, i heard that taking intuniv w/ stimulants rlly helps, and if i stick it out, the sedative effects of intuniv will subside. So I've been thinking of trying out intuniv with vyvanse, however with my current pysch, for reasons i already disclosed in another post, i can't really get stimulants easily. so i've been thinking of doing intuniv (which gives me low blood pressure), with strattera (which increases my heart rate), and maybe the two will cancel out? i'm not sure need thoughts, and if anyone has tried taking double non-stims before",2

147e46k,ADHD as social isolation/or lack of desire around social engagement," Im a woman in her early 30s. People often believe I'm at least 5-6 years younger than I am. Maybe cause I behave or appear younger. Does anyone else feel that ADHD isolates them from people/makes you turn inward or makes you want to contemplate/consider more internal things, than be expressive/engaging with people. Do you feel that ADHD is one source of loneliness or extreme isolation for you or even just that it makes you choose loneliness because you would prefer to not be overstimulated? Anyone feel that their adhd exacerbates their introversion? Sometimes I want to be social more than anything but other times I can spend a full week or more without seeing or speaking with a friend and I am content. Does anyone require huge amounts of time to recharge from some social interactions, like even just a single conversation can have the effect of making you physically exhausted? Curious because sometimes I am confused about whether this is a symptom of ADHD, depression, or simply a character/personality trait.",148

But the think is I am quiet during class, I am always moving and fidgeting but I don‚Äôt think teachers notice, especially in grade 12. I definitely think I have adhd and not just because I have the stereotypical symptoms but in the way that it‚Äôs actually causing me to struggle in life.  But that‚Äôs not the point. I just wanted to reopen my conversation on help and advice on what testing would look like, and what kind of person can do it, and what kind of person can‚Äôt diagnose.

147df1i,Should I drop out of school?,"I have been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately. Although I am take adderall, a part of me has been thinking about dropping out of school. While I have been doing great when it comes to doing the small stuff like doing the laundry, folding and putting them away, cleaning, etc. I find myself becoming paralyzed when it comes to needing to workout and going to school. 

I was just recently diagnosed so I am still figuring out ways on how I can do all at one. I work full-time, do (online) school full-time and I havent even been able to go to the gym in the last few months.

A part of me is thinking that I should just focus on my health at the moment and just go back to school later but a part of me is also thinking that i‚Äôm using it as an excuse since i‚Äôm on medication now? I don‚Äôt know what to do honestly..

147dbno,Failed my subject for the second time cus of my adhd.,"I failed my subject initially due to me being constantly overwhelmed with all the workload I was getting. It was a cycle of overwhelm, panic attack, executive dysfunction, and very high anxiety because the clock is ticking until it's become a month past the due date. I managed to get every single thing passed but one of my professors didn't grade my late works which took a huge hit to my grade causing me to fail and then retaking the subject.

I failed the same subject again. I have trouble studying. I'd always plan to study for exams a week or so before but always saw myself cramming the night before or actually 3 to 6 hours before the exam and I'm talking about cramming over a 100 pages worth of material. And because I haven't studied enough, I'd always fail my exam and it's just so frustrating because I know what I'm capable of. I'm really smart. But executive dysfunction, being unable to focus for the life of me, constantly getting distracted and doing other things instead of the task at hand, and even day dreaming whenever I try to study, are my biggest problems. It's fucking me over. I'd just like to point out I'm undiagnosed btw. I've tried going to psychiatrists and 5 to 20 mins into the consultation, they're already diagnosing me with other things like OCD of Bipolar Disorder which I know I definitely don't have. And whenever I bring up adhd, they'd say (I'm female btw) they'd ask me if I'm hyperactive, impulsive, the usual stereotypical symptoms. And because of that, I can't really tell my profs the problem because maybe they'd think I'm just making excuses. That I'm just lazy and dumb. That I'm just not trying hard enough. I don't have proof that there's something wrong with me. And this subject is a pre requisite of several other subjects. So I'm just waaay behind. I really wanna get diagnosed and see if meds will help because it's affecting my day to day life especially my studies. I'm fed up.",3

147d0j1,Why do I fall into these traps and say more then I should,"I reconnected with a high school friend at the beginning of the year. She is stuck in a high school mentality and my husband and I learned pretty quick she is full of drama. She sleeps around and parties like we are teenagers. She has 3 children and is hardly what you call a parent. She is completely broke all the time and is one of those people that says all the right things but does the opposite. I have always been brutally honest with her so she knows I don‚Äôt agree with her way of living. She was stringing this guy along who she didn‚Äôt have feelings for but needed his attention so she felt wanted by a man. He and I talked for a week or 2 about her unhealthy and toxic life. I shared with him that she had BV infection and that he should just be careful and watch himself. He turned out to be just as toxic as she is and I‚Äôm pretty sure he told her what I said. 

Why the fuck do I care if she is mad? I‚Äôm not even interested in being her friend at this point. I am not someone that ever would normally talk behind someone‚Äôs back but I was just trying to protect him. I feel like an asshole and wish now I would have never put myself in this situation.

147czu5,Any ADHD Apps for staying organised?,"Hi, I thought I‚Äôd give this forum a go. I‚Äôm a 43-year-old male, diagnosed at 39. It clarified a lot of things, but as is usually the case, none of us presents exactly the same, so I‚Äôm still figuring things out.

I‚Äôm not sure how many can relate, but my life and traits can be summed up like this:

a)

If something is important to me, I become hyper-focused and do reasonably well. If I know something is important to people I care about, it‚Äôs automatically important to me as well.

I‚Äôm socially comfortable and adaptable, sort of like an extrovert that requires a lot of personal space, if that makes sense.

I read my first full book at the age of 27. I had a very hard time retaining information imposed on me.

I completed 2 university degrees and have had my own businesses for the last 12 years. I got through university mainly because I became close friends with some people much smarter than me, so I could ask questions. That helped me work around the difficulty of retaining information by reading.

b)

If something isn‚Äôt important to me, I have zero motivation.

I‚Äôve managed to scrape by on things that have been ‚Äòmandatory,‚Äô such as primary and high school, but that‚Äôs it.

I divorced a couple of years ago and have my 2 boys, aged 7 and 9, living with me every other week.

In general, I‚Äôd consider myself a good dad. I attend every single event, and I used to pick things we could do together all the time.

What I‚Äôm finding very hard is to organize myself across business/kids/life in general.

It was easier when I had a wife/partner, but extremely challenging to establish a new routine that ticks all the boxes.

I respond very well to someone reminding me, but the lack of accountability doesn‚Äôt seem to work very well.

Can anyone relate, and does anyone know of a place to start?

Ideally, I‚Äôd have a life administrator üòÖ

Any input is much appreciated.",2

147bxur,ADD made me space out so bad I didn't realize I had put raw bacon on my burger and took a bite. The box was designed like (and located right next to) pre-cooked bacon so my brain automatically assumed it was cooked. I only realized it after taking a bite and having someone pointing it out.,"My sisters, husband, brother-in-law and friends decided to cook burgers and do a barbecue and play games today. I spaced out despite taking my meds and wound up eating a bite of raw bacon after putting it on my burger. We had bought ""microwave ready"" bacon and it looked like pre-cooked (in the same kind of box and located right next to the pre-cooked bacon) so I just assumed it was cooked and put it on my burger. Obviously everything got thrown out and I don't show any signs of food poisoning right now but I'll be keeping an eye out; a lot of the symptoms from getting sick from raw bacon match my IBS and other conditions so it'll tough to know what is ""bad"". I only ate one bite so I don't think anything bad will happen but still. Blech.

I made the joke about ""hey, I promise I won't turn into a cannibal"" (you'll get it if you've seen the horror movie ""Raw"") and then everything went back to normal. Shockingly my sister with a ""phobia of raw meat"" had almost nothing to say about it. However she did use it as an excuse to tell me ""you just need to pay better attention to things"" like I was deliberately just spacing out. I told her I literally can't control it sometimes (I have ADD and Functional Neurological Disorder w/ Paroxysmal Spells from a history of seizures and PTSD w/ Disassociative tendencies) so my brain just is a total mess.

147bvb5,Doc Now Acting Like He Never Gave Me More Than 40mg of Adderall Before,"Was diagnosed back in 2019. Had to go all the way up to 50mg while on neurotin in order to function properly(neurotin was for GI issues by another doc). At one point I was put on 60mg for about 6 months. I'm not really sure why, but at some point during the pandemic my psychiatrist kept going on about how the FDA is really pushing not going over 40mg doses and he kept finding reasons to lower my dose down to 30mg. At the time I was working for myself and off of neurotin so I was able to handle it, but now that I'm back working for someone else I'm at 40mg and he put me on cymbalta and trazodone to deal with sleep and anxiety issues that I didn't have when I was on the neurotin/adderall combo.   


I have tried pushing to go back to my old combo as he thought once I was done with my GI treatment that it might be worth exploring neurotin since I seem to get an anxiety benefit from it, but has now refused to not only prescribe neurotin, but also he now says that I am maxed out on ADHD medication even though I am barely feeling any effect these days which is exactly what happened 3 years ago when we decided to increase to 50mg. To this day I have never been so productive, orderly, and sociable as I was when on 50mg of adderall. I had a regular routine where my house was spotless, I meal prepped and got my clothes ready for the week like I was on a damn assembly line and was able to date without issues. I even figured out a way to make money outside of my main job during COVID which led to me leaving the workforce for 2.5 years.

I dont know what the fuck is the issue and what to do. I AM UNABLE TO MAKE A LIFE DECISION AND IT DRIVES ME INSANE!

Context: I've been working from home since the pandemic started. I used to live in another country at that point. It was a developed country, I had zero issues with money, the society is very open minded, they have burn out policies and overall money was never the problem while working there.

The pandemic came, I got laid off and I wanted to come back to my home country. Living abroad was very stressful although I had enough money. A housing crisis, a lot of hard life circumstances. Therefore I thought it was a better idea to come back to my country.

Which I did. I got a remote job in a new city which I did not knew anyone. After 2 years the job got toxic, I got burned out so I quit. Besides exploitation and m very high stress job which ultimately made me quit, I liked what I did. I had a management role and my colleagues were great. We were closed, my boss was nice etc. When the stress became unbearable I quit.

I found another job while I was still I'm burn out. This job sucks. I hate what I do ( I work in IT), my colleagues are mean and very rude. The job got very stressful so I can no longer handle it. The salary is the only motivation factor and the company benefits.

Now, I'm very conflicted. I don't fucking now what to do. I need to make a decision and I am paralysed. 

If I stay in my home country, I'll have to take another corporate job because these jobs are paid well. But I don't want to work a corporate job anymore. I don't want to work from home at all! That leaves me with the other option which is taking a regular job. But my salary would be downsized a lot. In half. Which means, I would have to move into a cheaper apartment and I deregulate a lot of I do any life transitions. But I would work a job with a lot less stress and effort. 

If I move abroad again, the whole process would be EXTREMELY stressful and painful. I would have to land money to be able to do this. I have a partner and two cats as well. But I would be able to get a job that I like which pays very well, isn't work from home or corporate and overall life satisfaction would be better because I would have more money. 

So I'm juggling between choosing what's best to me but nothing seem to be best. I find flaws in every decision I take. I am so stressed out, I'm ruminating for hours and hours and hours about what should I do. I came up with all the reasons and ideas and options but can't seem to make a decision.

If I were to follow my heart, I would take a basic job in my country, move to a cheaper apartment and try to relax. It would mean that I would afford only my basic needs. 

So I can't do that because it makes me feel inadequate and its very risky.

I'm so lost.... I'm so stuck. Please help me with any opinions. If anyone ever goes trough this. P.s. I believe I'm on the autism spectrum as well and i will be doing some assessments for it soon. I mentioned it thinking it could be relevant..",0

I am pretty skinny 135 lbs male with a fast metabolism I do eat a lot & pretty regularly Breakfast lunch and dinner idont work out a lot but I‚Äôm not lazy constantly moving or doing something

Question: BECAUSE of my fast metabolism should I wait 2-3 hours after taking vvayvanse to eat so I feel it more effectively. & should I take fish oil and drink more protein and work out more often to actually feel the vvayvanse working. Please let me know what you do and did you feel it working after you went to the gym and stayed figuratively healthy",1
1479uts,I got some questions about my life lol,"Hi, or ciao for me (about that: sorry for my English, probably not so good), I was diagnosed a week ago after some months of being pretty sure about it (and also forgetting that I did), and now I'm questioning if some stuff that I struggle daily with is just usual. For example: Do you have topics or people that u connect very often with stuff like min 2/3 times a day? That was stressful because one of my favorite brain connections is my ex gf, so yeah. Every time it has a reason, but it's like 10 brain connections away from the stimulus that triggered them, it's like some standard topics that my brain goes to because has an ""eased road"".

Or simply when I see people in the street very often my brain ""tries to recognize them"", like trigger automatically a person that I know based on the stranger looking or something.

Secondly, looking for a job: I know what I wanna do (more or less) and I know that I can't be 100% normal: I'm very into art, music, and cinema. but I'd also like to be a researcher, so it's needed to study a lot and just finishing my degree (I'm studying cognitive science btw) is already stressful. I have too many interests to persist so much just in one. Sometimes the hardest part is not ""doing the thing"" but not doing everything else. There is some researcher that can share his experience about?

Third, it's been a while now since I had any kind of love/sex relationship and I don't know why. probably too general shit to compare, but has someone ever experienced something like this? because I feel pretty lost and don't know where to restart (maybe I just don't remember how, lol). Much love 4 everyone <3",1
1479ltr,Getting tested in a few days and I‚Äôm nervous?,"Let me just say I‚Äôve always been bad with doctors, especially communicating with them. I‚Äôm 24 and I finally made myself an appointment with a new physician and after brining up ADHD he supported going to get tested as he himself has ADHD and didn‚Äôt really dive too much further into it as he himself said he‚Äôs not a specialist in the field so I respected that a lot

Now I‚Äôve made the appointment and it‚Äôs in a few days, and I can‚Äôt be more anxious about it. I feel like I‚Äôve been rehearsing the conversation a million times about how I want to present my symptoms and the issues I‚Äôm currently facing, awful procrastination, inability to truly focus on conversations and on other things in my life, memory, RSD, etc.., even trying to think about the symptoms sometimes I feel like my mind just blanks and then I‚Äôll question myself if I really have it. I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt be able to present it well, but they‚Äôre professionals so they‚Äôll know best I suppose.

Is this common? Reading other people‚Äôs experiences with it felt like a light bulb going off in my head and I‚Äôve really evaluated my childhood and thought about my behavior in school, being the smart kid but never studying, awful video game addiction, never being able to stick to a hobby. Now these symptoms have bled into my adult life but I‚Äôve been great at concealing them, even though I still deal with a lot of those same issues. There‚Äôs a thread on constantly reinventing yourself and having a grand scheme on life and I‚Äôve never related harder to it.

Of course this was years ago, and I‚Äôm just now preparing to move. No idea where these questions were posted. 

I remember part of it was about how we buy things that inspire us to aspire to be more or better or different. 

The below is a wandering description of the part of the list that struck me:

Ex: a person who owns books of each of Shakespeare‚Äôs works because s/he wants to be the kind of person who has read/studied all of Shakespeare‚Äôs works.  

The books aren‚Äôt on display for others to admire, but stacked by the bed. 

Questions related to this are 

-how would I have to reorganize my life, time & energy to be the type of person who has read & studied all of Shakespeare‚Äôs works? 

-Am I willing to do that now? 

-if it is a real desire or motivation, why haven‚Äôt I done that already? 

-can I accept myself as a worthy person if I let go of this image of myself? 

-Would it feel freeing or failing?

This list was more succinct. I could really use it now. I‚Äôm paralyzed by the overwhelming number of decisions I have to make over the next few weeks!

1478hrh,How to tackle school reading assignments with ADHD.,"Title says most of it. I have ADHD, and one of my largest struggles has been reading. I‚Äôm not a bad reader by any means, but I just can't get the focus to actually do it. I have tried, like *really tried*, but it doesn't work for me, regardless of genre or material. I try to read, and it's just so frustrating trying to focus on it for more than maybe five minutes.

Obviously, this comes up a lot in school still. I can sit through essays, short readings, and textbook chapters, but I just can't do full-length books. This is starting to really impact my grades, because you can really only do so well on tests and stuff without having read the material.

So I‚Äôm asking for advice on this. Does anyone else here have such a struggle with reading? How do I get around this? Do I just have to suck it up and try and sit through it anyway? I know you can set up plans for students with ADHD in school, and I don't know if that covers reading or not, but it doesn't feel fair to ask to just... not do it.

1478d0g,How much am I supposed to expect out of medication?,"I'm an adult and newly prescribed 10mg adderall.

I'm very disappointed by that, but I wouldn't say that 10mg is doing \*nothing\*. I think it gives me a very small boost with things like brain fog, or non concentration-heavy tasks like staying organized. So I'm very confused as to what is the medication supposed to do for me?

14776ji,Long acting medications not actually long acting?,"TLDR: Long acting meds seem to only work for a short time- what do?

Overview‚Äù
     I‚Äôve had ADHD for my whole life, only recently was able to get an official diagnosis and medication for it. 

I‚Äôve been prescribed Vyvanse 30mg to take for 15 days then 40mg to continue on. The 30mg is almost perfect for making me feel motivated enough to be productive,  so I can imagine the 40 would be perfect(or close to). The only downside on the 30 is that it doesn‚Äôt last.

Prompt‚Äù
     If I take my medication at 8am, it obviously doesn‚Äôt get into my system until around 8:45-9Am. I begin to feel slightly productive around 10am with the most productivity happening around 10:30am. It lasts until 12:30 when I get irritable and no longer have the energy to do anything- usually less than if I hadn‚Äôt taken it. 

So I get roughly 2-2.5 hours of productivity & then a wall that I can‚Äôt get through practically forcing me to stay on my butt and do nothing for 5 hours!

My doctor said that Vyvanse is a long acting medication but regardless of my lack of experience with ADHD meds, I can‚Äôt imagine that 2.5 hours is ‚Äúlong acting‚Äù. 

Is this a normal thing for ADHD meds? 
How did you fix this problem?

1476fcq,Why can't I hold a conversation?,"I can't hold a meaningful conversation or something that can last. 
 My problem is with anyone in general, even with my family, friends or coworker.  I see people who can talk for hours, which baffles me. I'm usually in and out, 2-5 mins tops and I'm exhausted/mind blank/headache and just can't think of anything.  There are some people who just like to talk and I find myself letting the person talk for about an hour and I'm only doing 5-10% of the talking.  Most of the time it's just acknowledging comments and facial expressions.  However, when something is emotional (like a girl talking about a abrussive relationship or any thing, I don't know what to say but ""I'm sorry you're going through that, you need to consider on getting out of that"" and that's IT... I don't add anything or make the person comfortable/happy...  This is why I can't find a relationship because I make a good impression, but then I get cold and people think I'm coming across cocky/arrogant (which people told me this) I've been told I'm a good-looking guy and very puzzled why a guy in his early 30's is still single with no kids or nothing... it's ""rare"" many say to me. I use to be very extroverted in my teens, but now I feel very introverted and don't want to talk. For example, I don't want to be around anyone when I'm on the phone... it's like I run and hide or avoid the call until I'm alone. I don't like talking to a group, even though I'm comfortable around them and I do come across like having a big ego (people told me this) so people wouldn't really see me as an introvert. Why am I like this? Is this ADHD? I hate feeling alone, even though I want to be alone. However, I do want a significant other... and I cry in the shower being alone. I found this one girl who seemed very interested in me but wants she noticed I acted childish and couldn't hold a conversation, she ghosted me and left me.

If I try to prep talk myself before a meeting, I get confused when I try to come up with things... some may say I have a lot of my mind/overthinking... but I feel like I'm just empty and blank with nothing to think about.  It's like you know that feeling when you're so tired, that your mind is ready to just fall asleep?  That's how I feel mentally, not physically.  I'm alerted, but my mind is just empty.",4

Just before I studied, I played it, and it helped me focus so much.  To slow down enough to do well at this really helped me.  The current version is terribly sensitive.  Don't use a trackball mouse.   Lower mouse sensitivity in your computer settings to make it easier.  I used it to train me to slow down reactions and thoughts to respond properly at more normal levels.  Now, I realize that it may have been the reason I was able to succeed.

1473u0c,Untreated ADHD and BED,"Hi all,

New to Reddit so apologies if I go about this all wrong.

It's been made clear to me (32F) over the last year that there's a high chance I have ADHD. 

I've spoken to my GP (UK), filled out the forms and I am now awaiting an assessment.

My biggest problem though, is food. My life revolves around it. It's all I think about all day. It's distracting me from work. I eat until I hurt and sometimes feel the need to almost choke on my food. When I'm actually hungry, it's like I can't function until I eat and I get incredibly angry until I do.

What I would like to know, is if anyone else has any tips on how to divert my thinking around food? Or even supplements which may help?

At this point, I'm desperate to try anything :(",1
1473s2m,What should I do?,"Hello everyone. First, sorry for my english, it's not my first language, but because the community is way bigger in English, I decided to join.

I'm not diagnosed with adhd, but I identify myself with practically all of the posts I have read of people with adhd of this community. I found it when suddenly Reddit sent me push notifications of some posts. I guess it was after I searched on Google for some answers to explain how I feel and somehow I discovered adhd.

After reading some posts, you have no idea how happy I felt that there are people just like me, that I'm not alone. I was like ""same!!"". Also, I was happy that someone could explain how they felt because it is very, veryyyy hard for me to explain how I feel, to find the correct words. my parents don't understand me, they would just say anything that doesn't relate to how I really feel. I don't think they have even heard of adhd or even think that I might have something. I've alway felt the weird one, i still do.
After reading some posts, I started feeling better and that my behavior (or just the way I am) is normal, and I should not hate myself.

Now, like I mentioned, I'm not diagnosed. I just started therapy a month ago because I think it will help me with some feelings I've been having for a long time.
Aaand now I have mixed feelings. I kinda want to be diagnosed because I guess it would give me some relief that there's a reason for my personality or the way I am. But I don't know, maybe I shouldn't feel this way, like why would someone want to be diagnosed with anything and not wanting to just be free and healthy, you know? Why would I even think of this? Ahh, I don't know.

Have you guys ever felt like this? Have some of you thought you had adhd and got diagnosed? Or maybe the opposite, you thought you had adhd and was told that you didn't have adhd? how did you feel?
How did you approach your therapist? Did you tell them directly that you thought you had adhd or waited to be diagnosed?

Thank you, guys, for your time.
Have a blessed day!",1

Especially if it‚Äôs bad, I just can‚Äôt seem to get past what I have done to myself and have found I am sulking and depressed because of my symptoms. I was delusional thinking I was an invincible teenage and college kid. Now I am out of college and life is getting serious. I am unsure how to get out of this rut and feel like I can‚Äôt keep doing this everyday. I have not seen my friends in a while and barley leave my house. I just sulk and I can‚Äôt unthink of a future without challenge from what I have done to myself. Frankly I think I am being dramatic and as scary as it is I quit and am going to become proactive to prevent further damage. I have struggled with sever ADHD my whole life and this past year Has been tremendously hard on my mental health. These symptoms have gotten much worse as of a month ago after I quit. I feel like I am wasting a valuable time of my life because I am scared of something that hasn‚Äôt happened yet and might not even happen at all if I am lucky. I just don‚Äôt know how to get myself up everyday and continue on with life like it was before my symptoms. I get chest pains and shortness of breath even if i am not anxious. Then i get anxious and sulk. I am lost",1

1473mvx,Started on methylphenidate XR last week and it really is like putting on glasses!,"I was diagnosed almost a decade ago and cycled through several stimulants. None of them really worked for me as I found the side effects to be worse than the problem itself. So I decided to go off meds and try holistic methods. Regular exercise, meditation and clean diet was enough to keep me functional but I would always end up working late or weekends to catch up on deadlines. I would say it reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms but I still had to deal with them. Last week I finally decided to switch after making a series of costly mistakes at work and this time I think i've found the right dosage! I took half of my recommended dosage and suddenly I can sit still and get work done!! I have no euphoria, fidgeting or heart palpitations! No teeth grinding or hyper sexuality like on Vyvanse. No mood swings like on Wellbutrin. I can fall asleep on time with a little bit of melatonin supplements before going to bed. So if you're reading this and the meds aren't working for you please try different doses and different meds. If you're like me, you might need very little. Ok, now back to work!",2
14710jv,Started to use Endeavor OTC: my experience so far (Day 3),"After making some headlines with their recent approval I downloaded the app to try to give it a try.

Background: I am in my mid-late 30s never diagnosed before but relate a lot to the posts on this sub and the adhd meme sub. When I saw this as a potential treatment option I wanted to give it an honest shot and share my experience in case some of you may be considering it. I'm mostly interested to hear from others to see if my experience is typical for someone diagnosed with adhd or not.

Day 1: did my first ""25 minute dose"" in the afternoon and was wiped out. Tired, irritable and a splitting headache afterwards. This happened immediately afterwards and for the following 4 hours. Then that night, I could pick up what my partner was talking to me about while watching TV. (Usually I am not able to listen to them talk if I'm actively watching something). This felt different and maybe a consequence of playing the game.

Day 2: I did my second ""25 minute dose"" first thing in the morning. Didn't feel tired this time and no headache. Went and did some earands including going to a mall close by. As we are walking around I noticed (for what felt like the first time) noticing my partner talk with me about things while we were walking around. I noticed myself not being distracted with what was around me and actually paying attention to what they were saying. This experience felt surreal. Like as if I was actually present in the moment for to first time in my life. Prior to the mall I also washed and vaccumed my car which was one of those things ive been putting off for 3 years that I finally actually did. The car wash + personal detail took me about an 1.5 hours and then I went to the mall after that. I never had the mental energy before then.

Day 3: did my ""25 minute"" dose in the morning. But this time had lunch after and I'm super exhausted again. It is Sunday but I'm not feeling as motivated but going to keep trying this everyday and see where I am after 6 weeks which is when they recommend to take a break from doing it.


The game itself is very involved but I can see what it's trying to do. I'm just curious if others have tried it yet now that its available on the app store. It isn't cheap but for someone like me that may have undiagnosed adhd it was worth a shot. If I keep improving I'm definitely going to see a doctor so I can get an official diagnosis. I also keeping a personal journal to document any changes.


Interested in hearing if anyone else has tried it.",2

14736yp,Any hacks or tricks on how to get things done you actually want to do?,"I'm getting frustrated because the **things I want to do/make me feel better, I don't do**, even though I know the consequences/rewards I still cannot get myself to do them. 

EX: I always feel good when I meditate, do personal art, do my hair/nails/skincare/selfcare, clean etc; but I don't do them. I know it's executive dysfunction and decision paralysis mixed with my own guilt I feel when I do things for myself, but that doesn't make it any easier to overcome. When I say it outloud to someone I feel crazy like ""Yeah I'd love to knit and draw and cook something right now! But I'm actually just gonna sit on the floor for an hour or quite literally stare at the wall instead.""

**Does anyone have any helpful tips that get them to actually tackle these tasks?** I should add I was on adderall extended release until last week when the shortage hit my area, but I wasn't seeing a huge difference so I'll be seeing my psych this week to discuss alternative stimulants. I feel like this might end up being the fix but because meds. are so unreliable right now for a lot of us, I feel like I need non-medication solutions more than ever.

The only thing that has helped me in the past is tricking myself into doing these things or I've found on rainy/dreary days I mentally feel like I can allow myself to do things for myself.",2

A few reasons that made me question are: I noticed I sometimes answer people‚Äôs questions before they‚Äòve finished because I feel they‚Äôre taking too long or I just feel the need to get it out. I struggle to finish tasks or chores, like tidying a room for example, end up starting something else like diy or rearranging stuff before I‚Äôve even finished the task of tidying. I sometimes get very angry and almost meltdown in anger and panic when I can‚Äôt find something I need like car keys for example.

It takes me hours more work than my peers to get anything done, and this has been the case since elementary school.

I can‚Äôt even get a diagnosis because my health company just puts me on hold and wont call me back. My last psychiatrist said she‚Äôs hesitant to continue the process of giving me a diagnosis because of the meds shortage. Also, because I‚Äôve had on and off struggles with depression and am AFAB, it‚Äôs made people less likely to believe me. They believe I‚Äôm just lazy.

1472h70,finally able to enjoy taking Concerta without adverse effects - things doctors don't tell you?,"Hi guys, I have been really struggling with taking my medication - due to some adverse side effects. Since my diagnosis, I have been on & off concerta. I find it is so helpful in focusing & getting school work done, especially when I am working full time... but some side effects I have been experiencing have been debilitating. 

I noticed that, not all days are the same. Some days when I take my concerta medication, I feel really good, other days I feel super anxious, irritable, my heart feels like its racing, and then at the end of the night I toss & turn with insomnia... I have found the days after I have insomnia I cannot take it because otherwise the concerta amplifies all of these horrible symptoms. BUT, I think I have finally found what works for me - let me know if you guys have experienced the same?

&#x200B;

1. taking my pills essentially as soon as I wake up 
2. not drinking coffee, or hot chocolate (anything with caffeine really--> I find it makes me extremely jittery and anxious) 
3. eating consistently throughout the day - and I mean very filling, healthy, and nutritious meals. before I take my pills I eat a bowl with yogurt, oatmeal, and berries. I find this really helps. 
4. and last but not least, I found these amazing tea's that I believe have been really helping me. I drink one during the day, which has **skullcap** in it - for a stress reliever. I find it makes me extremely relaxed  (since drinking it, I have not felt anxious or jittery at all from the conerta, but I am still able to stay so focused! In fact, way more focused, because the anxiety and jitters made it impossible for me to focus). Before bed, I've been drinking another tea with **valerian root, passionflower herb, and organic lemon balm leaf** which has been AMAZING - no insomnia at all!  
5. exercising later in the day has also been really helpful with the negative feelings I normally feel at the end of the day after taking concerta. 

just thought I would share this incase anyone else is having similar issues, but I find since doing all of these things I can regulate my mood very well, don't feel the come-down depression, can sleep well, and I can get all of my work done effectively. I wish someone would have told me these things earlier, but I guess some things are just about trial and error. I hope this can help someone else!

Doom 2016 is my all-time run and jump and shoot everything and rip that demon in half game. The secrets are satisfying to find, and it's great if I want a half hour fix.

The Room series of games are the perfect little video puzzles that test my patience at times, but are just perfect when that missing piece slides into place.

One type of game that was a big no for me was Disco Elysium. Especially when the voice acting wasn't done it was sooo incredibly tedious and I just didn't give a crap after 2 hours. My partner said that I was depressed when I played that one.

There's plenty more worlds I've explored. What are your games?

1470z70,Starting Strattera Before Exams: Good Idea or Not?,"  
Hi everyone,

I'm 24 years old med student, and I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. This is something I've suspected for a while but only recently sought professional help to confirm. My psychiatrist recommended starting on Strattera (atomoxetine) to manage the symptoms.  
The thing is, I've never taken any ADHD medication before, and I'm not sure how it'll affect me, especially under the high-stress conditions of exams. The trickier part is, I have important exams coming up in just 3 weeks.  
Here is my question: Is it a good idea to start Strattera now, just weeks before my exams?  
Thanks in advance for your help!

1470uod,Disconnect between desire to socialize and repeated isolating behaviors?,"For several years I‚Äôve noticed a decline in the variety of special interests/focuses/hobbies. After graduating into the pandemic most of my time was spent living at home with my dad or at work. When I was at home I pretty much just watched YouTube. Sometimes I‚Äôd play video games but would often be met with disappointment for not staying focused on job applications and trying to move into a career I actually enjoyed, as was my goal. 

Two years later I‚Äôve just landed my dream career, moved out of my dads place into an apartment a few minutes away. Except now I‚Äôm struggling with what to do with myself. I have no hobbies or interests, I‚Äôm very lonely and longing for friends to hang out with, but I seem to struggle with just leaving the apartment. 

Most of the time when I want to go out and do something I‚Äôll realize I don‚Äôt have anyone to do it with. It‚Äôs not all that fun to go out by yourself all the time. Sometimes if I really want to I‚Äôll go on my own, but it‚Äôs nowhere near as fun, satisfying, or fulfilling. All of my childhood friends live in my hometown an hour away, too, which doesn‚Äôt make things easier. And my new job is hybrid but mostly wfh so I‚Äôm feeling even more isolated now. 

Idk how to meet people, make new friends, or make plans anymore. It was easier in college to just walk up to strangers at the bar and make friends for the night, but even those didn‚Äôt last long term. 

In the past when I‚Äôve made friends, I‚Äôll invite them to hang out a couple times but those invites are usually shot down & that leaves me dissuaded & uninspired to try again.

The only thing keeping me from getting fired is I'm really good at what I do, am friends with management and am currently irreplaceable (that might not always be the case).

Getting an adult ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) diagnosis can have several benefits. While it's important to consult with a medical professional or a qualified mental health practitioner for an accurate assessment, here are some potential benefits that individuals may experience after being diagnosed with adult ADHD:
1. Understanding and validation: Receiving a formal diagnosis can provide a sense of validation and relief, as individuals may finally understand the reasons behind their lifelong challenges with attention, focus, organization, and impulsivity. It helps individuals recognize that their struggles are not due to personal shortcomings but are related to a neurodevelopmental disorder.
2. Treatment options: With a diagnosis, individuals can explore various treatment options specific to adult ADHD. This may involve a combination of medication, therapy, and lifestyle adjustments tailored to manage ADHD symptoms effectively.",0

And now after years of medication that wasn‚Äôt fitting and lots of appointments I finally got a vyvanse prescription. Let me tell you: I love it and it seems to work really well.
My problem until now was that I not only have ADHD but also BPD (both very severe) and because of that the comedowns of ritalin were awful, concerta made me feel really dizzy and just overall weird and overwhelmed and wellbutrin made my adhd induced anxitey stop but didn‚Äôt help to get things done. So now I‚Äôm here with the right anti depressants and vyvanse after all of these years trying so many things.

146xexy,I need help and dont know what to do,"I was diagnosed when i was very young (about 6 or 7 years old) with ADHD. I was a child that started to speak and read early, i loved history and archeology, i loved reading books about egypt civilization, and i had a very good memory, so i had a lot of ease in memorizing any subject, so i grew up listening that i had superior intelligence. In school, my grades wasn‚Äôt the best, but i never studied anything, and even didn‚Äôt pay attention to my classes, while a lot of friends and classmates reproved or got final exams, this school that i studied was known to be very difficult in the city that in lived, and one of the best in the city. Later when i was older, i managed to get into college in civil engineering with no problems, and exactly in that time that my lifed started to be a big mess. To be honest, i never liked civil engineering, my dream has always been to be a music producer, so i learned everything about it in internet and became pretty good at it, but my parents never supported my dream because of fearing that i would have problems for getting a stable life.
Now im almost graduating, and working in the area, and to be honest, i never felt so lost, tired and sad in my life. The hole path to almost graduation was very difficult and stressing and i suffered a lot, much because my brain seemed like to work only when it wanted, and i had to learn to like studying, so my grades floated on being very very good, and very bad. For instance, i managed to pass in a lot of very hard subjects with good grades, and had problems with others that wasnt that hard. Despite living like that, i still managed to feel fine, but now in the final of my graduation, and working, i had to start taking vyvanse, and this medication makes me feel very anxious and weird. Im feeling burned out, like and empty shell, and feeling that i‚Äôve done everything wrong. Actually i feel that i‚Äôve taken a direction in life that doesnt suits me. I cant see any perspective, im afraid to fail in life. Music prodution makes me feel much better and alive, but im in a stage of my life that i dont have the time that i would like to it, and everything started to scale into a very big snowball, that‚Äôs growing more, and more, and i cant find my self leaving this. A lot of bad thoughts constantly hits my mind, and i just have money to pay my psychiatrist and medication, maybe i should go to a psychologist too, but i cant now due money. This constant anxiety is killing me slowly, and fear as well. I'm also tired of constantly having to fit in with society the way they want me to. I dont want to live a life medicated. Im really really tired, i just want to live in peace.",2
146u6x4,"Lost motivation on meds, seeking advice and supportü•≤","I have started taking Ritalin sr about 2 months ago. I take 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon. For a while, everything was amazing, I had much easier time doing things, can finally concentrate for 2-3 hours and work and do sports. Lately, however, I have been exposed to some stress and my routine slipped. In the meantime, I realized I don't feel any motivation to do anything. Even when I accomplish milestones, I don't feel happy. I feel like my reward system is broken. I am prone to depression and have an MDD diagnosis. Took antidepressants for two years a while back but didn't need them for almost a year. This feels kind of similar but I still have energy to do stuff, I just don't see a point since nothing makes me happy. It has also really increased my anxiety. Has anyone experienced something like that? Could it be meds related? What do you do? Im just really stressing over thing cause depressive episodes are scary for me and I just started getting better... Thank you in advance!",1

As a result um stuck in a job I dont like because i dont know what to do with my life. I'm tired of changing my mind due to loss of interest in every thing I've thought I could be and it's very debilitating. I'm almost 30 and I really need to start making some real money if I'm going ro have a family soon. I feel like just picking one thing and sticking to it even if I hate it just to make a better income or I will always be stuck. I'm tired of having changing interests and as soon as I start to pursue them, the interest wanes or something new comes up. I have passion for nothing...nothing! It's so frustrating.",0
146xhi7,Ritalin and Carbs... Do they hate or Love eachother?,"I cant really have a carb heavy meal with my medications (Medikinet which is basically Ritalin), as I will get a racing Heart beat (120+ BPM). My doctor assured me that I was fine but it was definitely scary, so we both settled on me just avoiding carbs while the meds are in action.

Since then, I never had that heart issue again. 

But, I do feel like my meds arent working as well, if I dont eat carbs. So I try to eat a really small amounts, and when I overdo it with the carbs, it's back to 120+. But they do seem to support the effect of my meds, and they seem to be working longer (which is great because for some reason, No Matter how high the Dose, ill only get 1,5 hours worth of usable concentration out of them).

Has anyone noticed anything in that regard?",0
146xokx,I don‚Äôt know what to do,"(Will try to keep this short)
I‚Äôve been studying in Japan for almost a year now and I‚Äôve been struggling with my mental health for a long time. I am not a native and can not speak any Japanese. I had depression and anxiety since forever (years before I came to Japan) and it‚Äôs been pretty shitty. Recently I suspect I might have ADHD (all of the quirkiness I thought were mine are exactly the same as most symptoms from ADHDers, and some symptoms that seem to be everyday-human-thing but for me are really holding me back and affecting my life for the worse, really really worse). However I‚Äôve done most of my research online and through media which obviously are not the most reliable. I understand that self diagnosed is not ideal, and I would like to get professional help to properly diagnose me, but it is extremely hard. I need to find help somewhere where ppl can speak English and have experience in dealing with ADHD in adults (it‚Äôs already hard in Westerner countries, now we‚Äôre talking about JAPAN here‚Ä¶). It is even more difficult to find help in my home country (Vietnam) since mental health is still considered a taboo subject in Asia and it is generally really frowned upon.
I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do, this thing has been eating me up and ruining my life. I can‚Äôt focus in anything can‚Äôt do the most simple task frankly I can‚Äôt do life right now.
P/s: The icing on top of the cake is that I‚Äôm just a student living on government support (scholarship) so I‚Äôm scared that maybe I don‚Äôt have money to seek professional help.",0

The issue is, I barely got through my first bachelors degree and I‚Äôm nervous that it‚Äôll be the same this time. My first degree fueled a complete identity crisis, an array of addictions, and extremely unhealthy behaviors that I carried with me several years after graduating.

146ykzv,HELP - TIME BLINDNESS,"I HAVE A MAJOR ISSUE WITH GETTING TO WORK ON TIME. 

Context: A couple of days ago I got my first job! I am working as a cook at a restaurant/pub, and i‚Äôm still shocked they hired me. Even though i‚Äôve just started the experience has been amazing. The fast-paced environment feels so stimulating and the monotony of peeling a sack of potatoes or prepping vegetables is just the right amount of brain-numbing that allows me to stay focused on the task while my brain can spin.

What I am trying to say is that even though I really like working I just CAN‚ÄôT get there on time. It‚Äôs like my body physically can‚Äôt move until the very last second. The commute is long (45 minutes walking/public transport), the bus comes twice every hour and FOR SOME REASON I so far have always missed the bus that lets me be early. I tried setting my phone alarm earlier but I still don‚Äôt make it. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I thought that after I leave high-school my proclivity to consistently never being on time would disappear. I thought the real life consequences would kick in and my guilt would supersede my ingrained incompetence. I am desperate for advice. I can‚Äôt lose this job and I am clueless on how to prevent it. 

Should I try to do something beforehand like go to the gym to get my shit together?  That might sound dumb but my brain can‚Äôt think of any other solutions.",2

146yo8i,Question about finding a new doctor to prescribe my medication,"I recently moved. The doctor who refills my medication requires me to see her 3 months a year to receive my refills, and anytime I need to take a drug test to apply for a job requires me to go to her to sign off on paperwork to ensure I am not illegally using amphetamines. I usually have to take of a full day of work to do this since she is 3 hours away from where I live. I've asked if she could write me a referral to see a neurologist closer by me but she said she can't. I was originally referred to her by a therapist that I haven't seen in years. Has anyone else transfered to a new prescriber for their medication and how did they go about it?

146yevc,"I feel like no matter what I do, everyone thinks I‚Äôm an idiot","I‚Äôm 22 (F), recently diagnosed with ADHD (about a year ago), just got my meds a few months ago.
I‚Äôve always had like‚Ä¶ stereotypical ‚Äúgirl‚Äù ADHD. Yknow the kind that goes undiagnosed for years because it doesn‚Äôt manifest as extreme hyperactivity and more distractibility. 
Here‚Äôs the thing. I know I‚Äôm not stupid. Like, I don‚Äôt wanna toot my own horn here - but I‚Äôve always been ahead of my peers in terms of grades, I pick up on new skills pretty easily. During my ADHD evaluation the person doing it even made a note that I had higher than average intelligence.

Everyone around me treats me like an idiot and they have for years. During college I made friends and even though some of them had ADHD, they would make constant jokes calling me a bimbo and would religiously treat me like I was stupid, never knew what I was talking about, that I was constantly overreacting. Even now that I‚Äôm diagnosed and medicated and cut all those friends out of my life, I still get constant unsolicited life advice from my friends and family. The idea that I might know what I‚Äôm doing and it just isn‚Äôt what they want NEVER crosses their mind. Nobody ever asks me my reasoning behind any of my decisions.
My job cut my hours, so my parents keep hounding me to get a second job. The thing is, I spent a year trying to hold down two jobs and I was miserable the entire time, so I‚Äôm reluctant to do it again.
Everyone wants me to learn how to drive, but I‚Äôve stated multiple times that since I haven‚Äôt been medicated that long I don‚Äôt feel comfortable behind the wheel of a car yet. 
Whenever I lament about not having a lot of spending money or not being able to go many places, I don‚Äôt get sympathy. I just get told that I can‚Äôt expect things to be ‚Äúhanded‚Äù to me.
I feel like it‚Äôs important to note that during all this I‚Äôve also - become a certified teaching assistant, become a certified behavior technician for children‚Äôs therapy, taken my county‚Äôs typist test, and spoken with a financial advisor about how to best invest the $8,000 I‚Äôve saved up over the years.
It just feels sometimes like no matter how much I accomplish, it‚Äôll never matter. I‚Äôll just always be seen as some ditzy airhead who doesn‚Äôt know how to take care of herself.",3

I‚Äôll wait until I‚Äôm on the highest dose they want me on but going from 40mg of elvanse to 2x5mg of Ritalin a day is annoying.

He recently received additional testing as we were worried he may have additional learning disabilities that we may have missed, but it turns out he is a very smart person but simply cannot focus even ON Vyvance (he takes 30mg a day currently). 

The psychologist we worked with suggested trying different meds, perhaps cymbalta.

I was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age.  Before I started middle school, I was a pretty avid reader, always in a reading level ahead of my peers. I could sit down for hours if I had a book in my hand. Since middle school, my reading skills have declined dramatically. I have to read a lot of technical documentation for my field of study, and I find this difficult. Words often get mixed up when I read them, and I have trouble with comprehension.

At my age, in my country ever touching that amount of money is practically impossible. Now I have more debt than I have but I want to change that by not working for someone else but to finally focus on my projects.

At my young age of 23, I‚Äôve CDO, supervisor, office manager, branch manager, project manager, advertiser. I have all this skills I have acquired through thanks to ADHD, I‚Äôve been able to make other people rich but remain the same, pretty much just struggling with debt.

During my 48 hours at work I do not nor cannot leave the building. I. AM. GOING. CRAZY. I'm a Firefighter, I absolutely love(d) my job, unfortunately I have recently taken a job at a new department that does not go on calls and is unmotivated to train (something I was unaware of prior to accepting the job and moving across the country).  How the 12 other people I work with just sit in their bunk rooms for 48 hours and do absolutely nothing is beyond me, I'm envious of it though I'll admit.

I just sit in this building for two days straight and it feels like a literal prison sentence. I try to bring things to do, but it is very difficult to keep myself busy or entertained for that long. I can only read a book for an hour ( very generous) at a time, as well as just about any other activity. It gets to the point that by the evening I feel like I'm about to have a meltdown because I can't take the lack of stimulation anymore and so begins the dreaded loop of sitting in a chair, trying to find something new to do, being unsuccessfull then just looking at a wall and being unable to do anything but have my mind race. I work out everyday to try and cope, but that only uses an hour or two of my day. 

I'm actively trying to get with a different department, but it takes time. I am also in therapy to help cope with this. I just sit here 72 hours a week trying to talk myself down from absolutely loosing it. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to occupy myself?

146u85y,Is stimming a sign of ADHD?,"I have been stimming, or self-stimulating, ever since I was a child. This tends to appear in the form of squeezing myself and tensing different parts of my body whenever I get excited (and sometimes anxious). Coupled with this, I usually phase out of whatever is going on in front of me. As I've got older, I seem to have replaced stimming with regular visual stimulation i.e. watching videos online. However, I do still stim at times. Is stimming a sign of ADHD or is it something else?",2
146tpev,How to know if my forgetfulness is because of laziness/carelessness or ADHD?,"**TLDR:**

Got in a fight with my GF because I forgot about calling them back and realized that I've been forgetting a lot about things I care about. Is this ADHD?  


**Longer version:**

I am 32. And for as I long as I can remember, I have tendency to forget things.

In school/college it was mostly forgetting my belongings at school.  
Now, in work it's mostly forgetting meetings, personally it's forgetting events, calling back people etc.

\*I\* have always felt that it was because I was a lazy/careless person.

But recently something happened with my partner which caused a fight and when I thought about it, I don't think it was laziness.

I was on a call with them and got another call. I told them I'd call back. I took the other call from my balcony and it was a beautiful sunset that day. So when I disconnected the other call, I took some pics and went back in my room and started working.  
A couple of hours later, my partner called and we had a big fight over me not calling them back.

I knew I was wrong and I don't want to hurt them, so I did some introspection and I just couldn't relate to how my laziness/carelessness caused this. I do care a lot about them and I don't want this to happen. And I realized that my carelessness is not always the factor here. I love my work and try to do my best there, but there too I forget about calls and meetings.

I talked with my partner and a couple of friends and few of them mentioned that this could be because of ADHD.

The thing is me, my partners and friends are not experts about ADHD. And the sad thing is, where I live I don't have access to experts.

So, ADHD peeps, how do I know if my forgetfulness is because of my laziness/carelessness or ADHD?",3

There are thousands tabs open in my mind that makes it hard to focus on one thing in a time. I'm always overwhelmed and messed up. I wake up deciding to study and I have exam tomorrow. I waste alot of time scrolling on phone for hours. I forget that I should study. I put the phone a side and try to start. I stare at the book for some time then I get distracted again. It's so hard to hold on and focus for a long period. In college I forget to do the assignments even though I write a todo list but I'm always overwhelmed and my head is fed up of thoughts. I keep fail in my exams and study for the same subject for 4 years again and again. I also have bpd and social anxiety. I can't ask for help. I don't have friends and I'm so lonely.

146syqf,Friend who made fun of ADHD symptoms all my life now saying she has self-diagnosed ADHD,"I (24f) got diagnosed about 2.5 years ago and it was a massive relief. People throughout my life have called me 'out of it', 'DF' (drug-fucked--despite the fact I never smoked), patted me on the head, and been shocked when I got high grades because they saw my disorganisation/dreaminess as a symptom of low IQ. I had friends do this to me too, and though I have now cut out pretty much all of the condescending people in my life, there is one I am still in touch with. 

When I told her about my diagnosis, her response was ""oh yeah, I've watched heaps of tiktoks on that, I'm almost certain I've got it too."" I know self-diagnosis is important and necessary for some people, but this felt so diminishing. I'm not saying I know better than her--perhaps she does have it--but I know for a fact that I have struggled with these things a lot more than she has throughout her life. Her response felt so dismissive of my issues growing up, like we've always been on level ground and there was no reason for me to have struggled more than her.

When this happens I feel silly for getting antsy because I know it's not a competition. But I'm getting sick of telling people about my diagnosis to explain some of my behaviours and being met with responses like ""ohhh yeah, you're on that bandwagon too are you?"" or ""ahhh yes, the mental illness of the hour"" or people not taking the diagnosis seriously because seemingly 'everyone has it nowadays'. 

What do you think is the solution here? There is 100% a social contagion narrative surrounding ADHD and I think it's partially true--a lot of the symptoms for ADHD are really common human habits/behaviours, it's just the  degree to which it impacts your life that makes the difference. I can see huge differences between people I know to have ADHD and people who are merely claiming to have it. Will ADHD be taken less and less seriously the more 'awareness' there is of it? I remember a similar thing happening with depression but that seems to have died down a bit now. ",1650
146sxja,Should I change my med to stimulant?,"There are three medication choices to treat adult adhd in my country - concerta, intuniv and straterra.

I‚Äôve been on 2mg intuniv since Monday but the side effects are insane. I‚Äôm dizzy and tired af all the time. I have quite low blood pressure to begin with (80s/40s), and I‚Äôm anemic as well so that doesn‚Äôt help either. The dry mouth is horrible as well. I feel too self conscious to talk to anybody now because my breath must stink so bad!

The tiredness has somewhat lessened after adjusting the time to take the meds, and I feel like the dry mouth is getting better as well. But I still feel dizzy all the time. And my doctor told me that the side effects would only get worse once I increase the dose (and I will increase the dose) so I should just quit the meds and change to concerta if I‚Äôm getting side effects on low dose. (He originally suggested to get on concerta not intuniv at first but we decided to try intuniv after I told him about my situation.)

But the main reason for me to choose intuniv was so the effects last all day rather than for certain hours like stimulants. And because it supposed to work on anger and emotional regulations. I feel like concerta is just not suitable for my current situation. But even if intuniv helps me with my anger, if I‚Äôm too tired or dizzy to do anything because of it then maybe intuniv isn‚Äôt for me either. 

What would you do if you were me? Should I give concerta a try?

146sp11,Ladies pmdd/pms/period and ADHD meds,"This is a question for the ADHD ladies out there and I could really use some help. I started my concerta 18mg for the first time on Friday.

I usually get very fatigued the week before my period starts but the first day I took my concerta I felt calm, quiet head and my hyperactivity had definitely been lessened BUT I felt very drowsy and dopey like my inattentivness was worse. Around lunch time I felt them wearing off as my annoying narration in my head was coming back but I felt so effing tired aswell and it was so hard for me to finish my shift. I just wanted to know if anyone has experienced this on concerta or while you're menstruating? 
In a way I'm happy that my suspicions about my ADHD has been validated but I was really hoping that the meds would give me a bit more energy or drive to do things. 
I'm moving up to 27mg next week but I'm scared this will make me even more sleepy during the day. I'm really hoping that maybe it's something to do with my menstrual cycle that's causing me to feel like this. If any women have experienced this I would really appreciate some advice or anything.

Firstly, I'm posting this on behalf of a friend who is at the end of her tether, real crisis situation. 

Her 16 year old son has diagnosed ADHD and autism. 

He is aggressive, violent, and really struggles with anger management. 

He uses drugs daily, constantly asking for money and when told no, becomes violent and abusive. He's a big lad, and she's intimidated by him. Police have been called multiple times.

He refuses to go to school or find work and relies solely on his mum for money. 

He recently went out to Spain to try working, which he was initially excited about but when confronted with the realities of working life, failed to commit and gave up. 

In her words, that was her last hope for him. 

He's headed down a destructive path and I don't know what to suggest, she's tried all sorts, and it's just a repetitive cycle. 

He's demonstrated the ability to control his emotions when apologising for the abusive things he's said and done to his mother, but this is usually in the hope of gaining something in return, usually money.

Does anyone have any advice, anything at all I can suggest to her that might help them at all. 

I fully believe he needs help too, but he won't go to therapy, or use medication.",3

Concerta seems like an obvious option to consider. However, I'm not sure if the gradually increasing serum concentration is something that would work for me. I've heard something about tolerance building throughout the day, and it's to counteract that.

**Now I wanted to gather some subjective feedback, on how those on Concerta perceive it:**  
Are the effects consistent for you, or do they vary throughout the duration of action?  
If they are consistent, from when to when would you say they are?

146q9jl,How do you deal with being overwhelmed? I'm struggling.,"Having ADHD is one thing but when everything else begins to compound, it makes it FUN to say the least. I am struggling so much right now and I don't know if it's my ADHD, stress, anxiety, or depression? I feel like I've lost my drive even at home to help around the house like I used to. 

I walked into the kitchen this morning and just stared at how bad it's gotten. Groceries that need to be put away, cast iron that needs seasoning, dirty dishes, stuff all over the cabinets, floors that need to be swept and mopped... And yet, I expect my wife to somehow ""cook"" in this after working 12hr+ shifts all day? Last night, I felt even more awful after my wife pointed out we didn't have silverware for dinner because none got washed the day prior. (I didn't know I didn't and because I didn't communicate that, she got upset at me.) I haven't had a habit of dishes in a few months now because I'm feeling overwhelmed with everything.   


My wife works too, but she's part-time and when we got married, we agreed that the kitchen was my responsibility. She takes care of the rest of the house and even it's fallen into disrepair (we've been going through a lot too.) Between clothes that need folding to even the bed being made, it's just not getting done. My wife and I have talked about some of these issues but I'm not keeping up like I used to at all. I can't just dump all of my responsibilities on her either. That'd be so rude of me. 

It also doesn't help, that my job hasn't been the greatest either or our finances. I feel alone. I feel overwhelmed. I feel like I can't breathe because I can't even do something simple like take trash out. I can't remember the last time I sat there and laughed at something. My self-esteem has dropped yet again after being called ""boring"" and having a coworker tell me that ""I might learn something if I paid attention more at work.""

I'm sorry for rambling.... I... I don't know how to get ahead of the program again? ",2
146m53z,Weird cleaning hack that may or may not work for you,"Start with vacuuming. 

You‚Äôre probably thinking that doesn‚Äôt make any sense - vacuuming is done at the end, after all the crap has been picked up off the floor. 

But it‚Äôs so tedious and annoying to pick things up off the floor that it rarely gets done, and all the stuff piles up and the situation gets worse - even thinking about picking it all up is exhausting. 

In these moments, I pick up the vacuum and start it up. I start from one corner of a room, and I encounter obstacles immediately. I pick those up and decide what to do with them - maybe hang them up or throw them away. Then, I vacuum and clean the empty area. I find another section and do the same; I repeat this until the room is tidy. 

Is this an efficient way to clean? No, not at all. Does it take me hours just to clean one room? Yes, it usually does, but I get it done, and I‚Äôm not full of dread about the overwhelming task at hand, because I just focus on one section at a time.

146pem5,Simple Morning Hack,"It's taken me far too long to discover a surprisingly effective way to drag myself out of bed in the morning: the urgent need to pee.

Now, when morning arrives, I have no choice but to jump out of bed instead of mindlessly scrolling through my phone for way too long like I used to. This simple trick has transformed my mornings and freed me from being tethered to my phone all day.

As soon as I'm in the bathroom, I feel like I'm on a roll, having avoided wasting an hour in bed scrolling through social media. The small yet fulfilling sense of accomplishment from taking immediate action propels me into a productive morning routine. I even tackle tasks that I usually procrastinate on until late at night, like basic chores and feeding myself.

What's even better is that by starting my day actively, I find myself less 'satisfied' with my phone throughout the day. Instead, I derive more fulfillment from actually doing things and engaging in real-life activities.

146p9bl,Wanna read more books?,"Sup my fellow dopamine deprived fucks,

So you want to read more, but reading is hard... you keep wandering off in your mind because some word reminded you of something and now you've read 2 pages without taking in the information and you have to figure out where you stopped understanding and re-read from there only to then wander off again a few pages down the line
And this only ever happens if you actually manage to pick up a book

Anyways, I found a nudge that works for me:

The 1000 books list

That's right 
We readin a thousand whole books
Only limited by the ultimate deadline 

That's waaaay to many books you say
I have only ever read 5 books when I was a teenager you say
That's not what it's about I respond

Once you open up your memo app (or your planner if you actually manage to use one, look at you, you organisational behemoth) to write down some book titles you want to have read in your lifetime, a few things will happen:

- you don't know a thousand book titles, you're gonna have to ask friends for recommendations 

- you're gonna get excited about reading some of the books on your list

- you're gonna start buying books

- books everywhere

- *whendoesthereadingstart?!?*

- everytime you see a book, you'll think uh I wanted to read a thousand of those, better get going and read a few pages 

- because you've just bought some books and probably ordered some that will get you excited when you receive them, you're gonna see a lot of books from now on

- put them in places where they are visible and easy to pick up 

- be strict with yourself, you don't want to be one of those fuckers that puts fancy books with fancy names on their shelves to look sophisticated, read them first, then display them decoratively

- if you're like me, you'll get the stick of the book at around 30-50% through the book, so it doesn't give you nearly as much dopamine as the start of the book

- don't start another book at that point, please, I am begging you from the reading 5 books simultaneously at the moment part of my heart, you're not gonna finish any of those

- the trick with this list is to use the excitement you have for wanting to read a new book as a reward for finishing the one you are reading right now

- the amount of times I've picked up my current book because I saw a future book is absurd

- if you finish a book, reward yourself with writing it on the official 1000 book list with a nice checkmark behind it so you can confirm for yourself that you managed to read that whole book

- if you keep this up, your list will get longer, you're gonna read more, talk more about reading, get better recommendations, therefore have more future books to be excited about, therefore have more motivation to finish your current book, lengthening your list, making you prouder of yourself with every entry

- the sweetspot for me are non fiction books with around 200 pages but don't just stick to one genre or length, good writing can be found in every corner of the world

Using the deadline of existence itself is a very chill motivator aswell, the amount of lifetime I have left is an abstract construct that doesn't really allow me to procrastinate and 1000 books is way to much to handle in the final days of that deadline, I'll have to put in effort whenever I can, to even get in the realm of achieving this goal

Finally, the controlling instance is myself, I'm not very strict with myself, so even if I'm laying on my deadline bed having read 200 books because fuck is it June again already? I'm not gonna be like ooooh I'm such a failure I haven't managed to reach my own goal, I've read 200 books more then I would have without this list so I've successfully fooled myself into doing something I love anyways, good job me. 

Finalinally, be mindful about your reading, try to read real books and take the time out of your day to read them, sitting in a comfy space, this slows your brain down and we need that from time to time. Don't beat yourself up if you've wandered off with your mind, this will happen and that's okay, just get back to where your mind left and keep going from there, you have a whole lifetime to finish the book, there's no rush, you're doing this for fun and there is always the possibility to just put it down and try it again tomorrow :)

146mlbb,"Extended release Vs short acting, and dopermine seeking behaviour?","I've tried searching for some studies but there isn't much on it, but I'm curious, if for some people, extended release is worse for dopermine seeking behaviour than short acting.

Apologies, long post, but wanting your thoughts and experiences on the matter, and the below gives some context.

I've been on vy(el)vanse for about 10 months now, at first it accelerated my morning routine, health, with regular sessions to the gym. I was meditating every morning, well prepared for the day, and arrived to work early or on time too! 

This felt truly life changing at the time, I was on 30mg, I felt great, although, there was a small part of me that felt a little detached from myself. 

These effects quickly wore off, I'd never been so productive at work, but after lunch I'd crash,  and the productivity gained in the morning was lost by the afternoon.

I was prescribed a booster dose, but again after a couple weeks I felt less productive. I was moved up to 50mg in the morning and kept the 20mg booster at lunch. This seemed to work great, I was productive at work all day and have been ever since. 

Over time, negative side effects increased, I felt more detached from myself, I was vaping more, drinking more, seeking more and more stimulation throughout the day. Looking back, I can see clearly that the more I seeked instant stimulation, the less I was going to my gym, meditating, and the hangovers I should have experienced were masked by the stimulants, it really was a domino affect from there.

Another thing to add, I've since started my own business and whilst the focus is great, I don't take a step back and prioritise tasks, so I probably waste too much time on less important tasks.

I have a history of drug abuse and drinking, hense why the Doctor started me on atomoxitine (made me tired and really aggressive), before moving me onto vyvanse. The financial pressure of vyvanse also pushed me to speed up the process.

Reflecting on the last year, prior to the meds I had developed lots of positive ways of managing my ADHD, the meds helped encourage this at first but overtime I was back to old habbits and I've stopped the good ones.

I've realised this a few months back, I've been going to the gym, but my mind's always on work and I'm not getting a lot out of it.

I've tried a break from my meds, and I'm exhausted, my short tempers back, low patience, and background noise gets to me more. 

I don't like the  version of me when off my meds, and I don't like the version on my meds, not an ideal place to be. 

I'm being moved to medikenet XL 20mg, it's 50% acting 50% delayed, I'm hoping this will be a better outcome, and I'm not going to run through the process this time.

As an addict, I had learned how to deal with stimulation and accept highs tapering off, but I'm curious to whether the slow release of vy(el)vanse, constantly trickling away throughout the day, has been the reason to these negative effects? 

Anyone else had a similar experience, and found shorter acting helpful? 

I know medikenet XL is still long acting but more like 6-10 hours than 12-16. 

If you got to the bottom thank you, and your meds must be working great! ü§£",1

I'm not good at planning financials and every time I get paid my mind always thinks about the possibilities. I'm ok at restraining myself, but I do occasionally let myself buy something inexpensive (Even if I haven't looked at how much I need for bills.

146ma57,What can I even do anymore?,"Hi Reddit, sorry for the vague title but I am not exactly sure what to even call this. Just a fair warning. This post is a mess. Read all the way to the end tho if you have any thoughts youd like to share. I swear the end is important to this post. Hell if you wanna skip, and read the rest after, go ahead.

&#x200B;

Lately IRL quite a few things happened to me. All unrelated to ADHD on its own but due to my current situation I got a lot of time to sit and think. Basically I broke my foot. Dont worry, I dont need surgery, just have to sit this one out for a few weeks and its all gonna be gucci then. But thats only one problem of mine.

&#x200B;

The other is, well, ADHD. Something I noticed and thats not just now I am just now finally able to ask on this forum for some god damn reason, is the fact that I cannot turn my brain off. Now you may laugh at this cause it sounds nonsensical but the issue for me is quite literally that. I am constantly multitasking, apart from now due to information overload. I need some peace and quiet for once to think.

&#x200B;

But often times I either:

A. dont have that or

B. dont seek it automatically

&#x200B;

I do so many things on the fly that I dont even notice that I miss half of the stuff I should notice in the first place. Art, Social Media, videos and movies too. I just today had a conversation where by the end I felt super bad cause it felt like I wasted their time due to my own stupidity. I wasnt stupid mind you, I just... couldnt shut my brain off and just sit there to take in what they said in full. Luckily its not a big bad convo we had, nothing too important either but it still makes me feel terrible cause it feels like its something out of my control.

&#x200B;

On one hand I need to multitask because otherwise I feel like I am wasting time and on top of that I cant concentrate easily. I need music to draw, play games and so much more. I need to listen to something in the background even if the game already has a banger soundtrack. I need something familiar, turning off the music in even Elden Ring. And why is that? Cause while I play and listen to music I also delve straight into Daydreams to expand my ever growing universe of ""Fuck you Author, why do you do this to yourself. You never write any of it down. What the fuck is your problem???"".

&#x200B;

I just dont know what to do honestly. My heads in a bad spot due to my broken foot. ADHD on top. I feel I am just making mistake after mistake, feeling like a failure again (I know thats all just in my head, dont worry I am aware that this is just ADHD depression pushing itself to the top, but it doesnt make it any easier of course).

&#x200B;

So... why did I make this post? I dont know. I am honestly not sure. To ask for possibly someone who knows what to do in such cases? I already took myself off of Social media for the next week or two, just to get my brain to rest a lil cause jesus I hyperfocused on almost anything I was just drawn in by very fucking slightly! And yes. I am medicated. 30 in the morning, 10 in the evening. I was allowed to up my dose from 20 to 30 and it worked well but now it feels like it does jack diddly shit.  I can focus more sure but I spend half of the time focusing on stuff I shouldnt focus on! I should focus on art! What do I do? PLAY VIDEOGAMES FOR EIGHT HOURS?!!

  
I got like 5 projects running at the same time, two comissions to finish and what do I do? Grind in a bloody minecraft Modpack cause the Apotheosis mod does the ""Funny Numbers go up"" Game! And I can even do that without music!! HOW? HOW DOES THIS BRAIN EVEN FUNCTION?  


I feel like a broken mess. Like a clock thats broken. I am right twice a day but the day was yesterday and it never becomes tomorow. And I have been feeling like it for a while. The first few months of taking meds this year were great. Finally medicated. I was focusing so hard on art, got shit done at home and man it felt good to be in control and now it feels like I am just falling back into the rotten past I wish I could have left behind! I wanna be myself and be in control of myself. I wanna enrich the life of friends and family, not be a liability that constantly worries about having pissed one of them off over one dumb thing I said ffs!

&#x200B;

I just wanna be normal. Or get closer to it. I dont care. I want something that I can do to deal with this crap. Fuck...

&#x200B;

I swear this wasnt supposed to turn into a depressing rant but somehow it just started going and going and going and boy dont we all know that feeling. Once you get talking you dont ever shut the fuck up. Listen. I may come over like I am really sad and depressed but at the same time this is the way I like to write out posts. A bit over the top, a bit emotional. It helps. But at the same time, these are my very raw thoughts. And if any of you have any opinions or comments that you think could be helpful in my case, I would love to read them. Thank you for reading this far if you havent skipped lol

146lx7z,Why is L-lysine used in Vyvanse?,"I understand the prodrug nature of Vyvanse and the cleaving of the lysine by red blood cells to convert it slowly into dexamph.

146lum3,Feel like no one likes/understands me,"I (24f) grew up with a large group of truly genuine and close friends. I have always said that friendships and connection are the most important thing to me, and i‚Äôve always felt really safe and loved and comfortable with my friends. I would truly and genuinely say/believe that the one thing in my life that I was sure of in my life was the people in it. I‚Äôve always felt supported, and like I had many many people who understood me that I trust wholeheartedly.

Recently, my ADHD traits have become much more prominent in my life, and i‚Äôm starting to become aware of a lot more of the ways it presents itself for me.

I was sitting up at the cottage with my best friends in the world this weekend and had a moment where I was over sharing about a subject i‚Äôve been hyperfixating on and I realized that everyone seemed disinterested and like they were uncomfortable that I was saying so much that they didn‚Äôt relate to. Then, when I tried to apologize and back track and the subject was eventually changed, I had a moment of clarity that I am always the odd one out. I always over share or get too loud/invested/say the wrong thing - and these are my genuine best friends. I kept thinking and slowly started to realize that I don‚Äôt know if they even really know me - it feels like they‚Äôve all just learned to love me when i‚Äôm masking.

146ljfn,Vyvanse for Fatigue,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience with Vyvanse and seek your thoughts on its safety without a formal diagnosis. 

For the longest time, I struggled with fatigue, lack of motivation, and disorganization. I‚Äôm on thyroid meds and everything else has been addressed such as b vitamins, iron, d and so on

I didn't feel sad or depressed. I started researching and even took online tests for ADHD, which show I have some signs..and indicated I would fell into the inattentive category. 

Growing up my backpack was always a mess, and my room was in constant disarray, despite teachers consistently recognizing my intelligence and attributing it to extreme disorganization.

Curious about potential solutions, I approached my doctor, who is open to exploring different treatments. He said I could try it out. He prescribed me 20mg of Vyvanse, and to my surprise, it made a difference after a couple weeks. My mood improved, waking up became easier, and I became more productive and overall a nicer person to be around. However, when I experimented with 30mg, I experienced jitteriness that was too uncomfortable for me. So I went back on 20mg and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently on.

My main concern is whether it is safe for me to continue taking Vyvanse without a formal ADHD diagnosis. I currently have no need for antidepressants, as this medication seems to be working well for me. I've contemplated going down the antidepressant route, but Vyvanse has been effective so far.

I'd appreciate hearing your thoughts and insights on this matter. Thank you!",1

146kj0r,I am struggling with my ADHD husband,"Hello.

Some background.  I have ADHD which is relatively well managed.  I do the usual stuff like collecting hobbies, setting things down and walking away because I just remembered what I was doing before I picked the thing up, dopamine mining, etc.  But I have worked hard to manage my life with lists, spreadsheets, schedules, pomodoro method, and various other tools.

&#x200B;

My husband and I have been together for ten years, married for eight of those.

&#x200B;

His ADHD is not so well managed.

&#x200B;

At least, I don't think it is.  The other option is something I don't want to be true.

&#x200B;

I am struggling with him helping out.  I just went back to work full time about 3 months ago.  He also works full time.  Because I now have a VERY TIRING 50 hour a week obligation outside the house, I am no longer able to do all the cooking, all the cleaning, all the yard work, all the laundry, and all the errands.  I need some help.

&#x200B;

Y'all, I have to tell him to do EVERYTHING.  Dishes go in the kitchen (at the very least not in the living room.) Groceries need to be put away.  Laundry needs to be done.  Lawn needs to be mowed.  Dogs need to be medicated, fed, and watered.  Litter boxes need to be emptied.

&#x200B;

The latest development?  Had to go out of town on a quick road trip to deliver something and make some money (jewelry, nothing illicit).  For the past two weeks, I have been telling him to clean the condenser units for the AC on the house.  I reminded him again yesterday before I left.  I came home today and the house is 80 degrees because the condenser units are filthy and so they aren't working.  He's asleep.  I caught it in time, but that could have broken our AC and cost us literally $20k or more.

&#x200B;

If I say nothing, literally none of that will get done unless I do it.

&#x200B;

Here's where things get hinky.  I have seen him clean the whole house.  He did something really inconsiderate and made me mad and I went for a drive and to have lunch with a friend to cool off.  When I came home, house was spotless.

&#x200B;

I have seen him do laundry.  The internet was down.  I had to go do some work stuff.  When I came home, clothes are clean and folded and put away.

&#x200B;

I know he CAN do these things.  And I know he knows they NEED to be done.

&#x200B;

I'm starting to feel almost like he's weaponizing his ADHD.  I feel like he is intentionally choosing not to do things because he knows I'll just get fed up and do it myself.

&#x200B;

He's 38 and was diagnosed when he was 13.  He is well medicated.  He has learned all the same tools I have learned.

&#x200B;

I'm tired of having a child.  I don't want kids.  Never have.  But I feel like he's my child.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do.

146k4gk,Considering seeking an ADHD diagnosis,"I‚Äôm considering going to a psychiatrist to see if I have ADHD. However my parents would be completely against the idea because my whole life they‚Äôve told me I‚Äôve been battling ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù rather than it potentially being something pyschological. I am of legal age to seek a diagnosis alone but my country (Aus) seems to require my parents to confirm I‚Äôve had symptoms before the age of 12. 

I want to rule out the possibility I have it, if I don‚Äôt then I simply know it‚Äôs a motivation problem not anything underlying. However I don‚Äôt have a support system and it is giving me pause.  
Where I live a diagnosis could cost upwards of $1000, and usually requires parents to confirm that some symptoms started before the age of 12. I could afford the process but it would be almost all the money I earn in a month. 

I‚Äôm quite nervous. I‚Äôve always been a good student and never had anything bad put in my school reports (something they use to diagnose). I‚Äôm a law student and on paper it not worth me even trying for a diagnosis since I‚Äôm a decent student. 

I‚Äôve researched the guidelines and I fit into multiple (not only lack of motivation). 

Just looking for insight :))

Edit: the main reason my parents would not support me going is mainly due to the fact they just think I‚Äôm a lazy slob.

146jppy,Something about alcohol helps me focus. Do stimulant medications work similarly?,"Two examples: I go out to gigs frequently and I‚Äôve realised that to enjoy them I have to have a few drinks beforehand and during.  Without alcohol it‚Äôs just like an offensive wall of noise and I get bored immediately.  After a few drinks I still hear everything all at once (as in not having to actively focus on individual sounds) but it‚Äôs so much more cohesive and all the sounds seem to slide into the ‚Äúright‚Äù spots in my brain so that I can digest it nicely.  It just flows a lot more easily for me.

Second example:  I can‚Äôt do a large tidy (like my bedroom) sober.  My willpower and energy are at 0 and I visually perceive the mess as a solid block of, well, mess.

It seems to help, but only lasts a few hours. The rest of my day I'm irritable, tense. Had a slight anxiety episode during the latter half of work. It passed and was manageable.

Got home, immediately lost all motivation to do anything. Still feels like I have all this drive to do something but none of the executive function to back it up. I feel focused, but at the same time, inattentive, anxious, and burnt out. It's bizarre how these symptoms seem to overlap and contradict each other. As if my brain is being just as selective as before.

Hasn't made my anxiety worse, but I still feel quite anxious (bruxism, stimming, intrusive thoughts, etc.)

Another hill to climb, I suppose. Thanks for being such an awesome community.",3
146igbb,"Prolonged procrastination - It's either the extreme lack of willpower, or extreme fear of opening up tasks for me.","Pretty much the title. I struggle with a lack of motivation that seems to be intrinsic in many of my peers. This lack of motivation usually accompanies a bout of depression triggered by bad news or unpleasant circumstances that are mentally demanding and draining. But on occasions when I do magically have the willpower and my mood is good for the most part, I am TERRIFIED of opening up my Moodle and looking at the tasks I've failed to complete, of all the assignments I've been graded an 'F', of all the discussion posts I had promised I'd do before everyone else but didn't - just like right now.  I'm so scared of opening up Moodle because I have a pretty good feeling I might fail this course I've been taking this term, and I have partially mentally checked out. But then I still have guilt eating away at me because somewhere at the back of my mind I have this feeling that maybe I might get the least possible grade to pass. The fear and lack of confidence is debilitating, but I just can't do it anymore. What does everyone else with extreme lack of motivation do to get over task fear, after prolonged procrastination?",2
146iluo,I experience extreme exhaustion after working for long hours at office.,"I am working on a job where I have to stay on screen 8 hours at my office daily. I usually can not focus unless I hyperfocus. SO what I do is I hyperfocus on my work which means I keep on working without taking a minute break and without ever leaving my chair once. I even forget to drink water while I am working. After few hours I get extremely exhausted like I am so sleepy that I can barely even open my eyes. It feels like my brain is temporarily half shut down. I just want to take a nap but I can not do that at my office so I keep on working until the exhaustion state goes away again. Has anyone experienced this? 

I am inattentive type, if I knew I had Adhd long back, I wouldn't put myself through all the nonsense - taking tough courses cause parents thought I was smart, waking up at 5 am to attend classes that lasted till the evening and I was wondering why I couldn't perform well on my grades like I used to. On top of that I blamed myself for being so lazy. I would have chosen an easier route to my life. ",4
146ip4n,üêï‚Äçü¶∫ü¶Æ Is owning TWO dogs harder/feel different than one? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü•∫,"TLDR: 
Emotional support dog of 16 years died. Big guilt/grief now for neglecting him pre-ADHD diagnosis. Thinking of adopting 2 next time to each have a playmate. But worried it will take more executive functioning and be less emotionally fulfilling. 

Link is below with pics! üòä
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

My sweet boy died 5 months ago. I had him for 16 years- my entire adult life living on my own. Never suspected ADHD but was diagnosed 2 years ago and so many past mental health challenges now make sense. So glad I‚Äôve been on successful treatment for 1 yr because I don‚Äôt think I would have survived this life transition if not. Indeed that dog probably saved my life at least twice. 

It has been so hard, though, because of the extreme guilt. When I was in my early 20‚Äôs and very dysregulated from anxiety/depression/ADHD I was a bad pet parent. Could barely get out of bed some weekends so he‚Äôd go 12+ hrs without being fed or let outside. I probably scared him when I‚Äôd hold him to self sooth during crying meltdowns I had a few times (I‚Äôm probably autistic af). 

When he was a puppy, I was about to walk out the door for a camping trip when I saw him staring up at me and I realized OMFG YOU HAVE A DOG TO TAKE CARE OF YOU IDIOTü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è! Thankfully a friend (who he‚Äôd never met though) volunteered to watch him. 

Once, before I had good control over my emotions, I lost my temper after he ate my favorite shirt and I tried ‚Äúwhipping‚Äù him with it while yelling at him (don‚Äôt worry- a tshirt full of holes has no heft behind it, but I know I scared himüò≠). 

On the whole though, I we were great for each other. He was a small lazy hound mix so was very low maintenance and well behaved. Perfect for my ADHD. He kept me on routines, got me outside on walks, and helped me socialize by taking him when I visited friends (everybody LOVED him). He really became a part of my very identity. Whenever I was upset he provided hits of dopamine joy and motivation any time I just looked at him. I very quickly changed my ways and babied him most of his life. In his final years I very much prioritized him above all else. And in his final months when he had cancer, I repaid the lifelong comfort he‚Äôd provided me and I went out of my way to ensure he never suffered. 

However, I do regret that I didn‚Äôt play with him as much as I should have and that he had to spend most days alone while I was at work. I now have a 100% wfh position but who knows how long I may do that. I‚Äôd like my next dog to have less alone time, so I‚Äôve contemplated getting two. I also wonder if that will make grieving easier to have one left when the other dies. But that also means double the cost and logistical problems of care, cleaning, and ownership; and double the worrying about their health and safety. 

Does that also mean double the reward and happiness? Would it be hard to feel that sense of calm and bondedness if they aren‚Äôt BOTH in your bed or on your lap? Would a second dog just divide my attention and tax my focus and other executive functions more?

Thank you in advance for your thoughts.

But since I proposed it, people expect me to organize it.

I dunno why these strangers would do that. I don't organize gatherings. I show up early and wait before entering gatherings because if I'm not 5 minutes early, I'm late. I stress about really esoteric details if I'm organizing. I will not send out reminders...or requests. I'll definitely say something awkward in text that sounded funny as hell in my head. I will propose very few solid solid rules because I'm an impostor and definitely shouldn't be telling people what to do. They should know better.

\---------

Think of the brain of a person with ADHD as a unique and dynamic company teeming with potential. The CEO of this company represents the decision-making part of the brain. They have bold visions and innovative ideas, and they've hired a team of highly talented, creative employees who are ready and eager to work. The COO represents the brain's executive functions, responsible for organizing and carrying out the CEO's directives. 

The employees represent the various cognitive processes, ready to spring into action. However, there's a hitch in this otherwise promising setup. The company's internal mail system, which symbolizes the dopamine pathways in the brain, is faulty. This system is crucial for relaying messages from the CEO through the COO and to the employees. But often, these messages arrive late, get lost, or are misinterpreted due to the malfunctioning system.To complicate things further, this company has a unique rule: the more complex or urgent the task, the higher the 'postage fee' required to send its instructions. 

When the company runs low on its budget (or mental energy), the mail can't be dispatched, causing further disruption.So, even when the employees are ready and willing, and there are pressing tasks at hand, the instructions don't arrive, or they don't arrive on time. This isn't because the employees (actions) are lazy or unmotivated but because the mail system (dopamine pathways) isn't functioning correctly. This breakdown often results in a kind of ""paralysis"" - the employees want to work and are ready to go, but they can't get started without their instructions.Sometimes the employees will take things into their own hands, and a spark of creativity produces something unique, something that genuinely drives the company forward in a way that could not have happened with too much micro-management from the top. often though the employees, with all the best, will end up working on non-essential and not necessary tasks to the overall goals of the company.

From the outside, it might seem the employees are simply not doing their jobs. In reality, they're stuck in a holding pattern, waiting for messages that are delayed or not coming at all. Or they are working very hard on random tasks of their creation. This misinterpretation is one of the most challenging parts for the CEO, who can see the raw potential and dedication of the team but feels powerless to fix the communication issue.

The CEO, aware of the talent within the company and the potential for success, feels a deep frustration. They understand that the employees are far from lazy; they're trapped in a flawed system that hinders their performance. The world, however, only sees the surface - the missed deadlines, the potential not fully realized, and mistakes that seem easily avoidable.

Of course, if the company manages to tap its creative potential, it may be able to rise above some of these issues. All of the different and creative ideas the employees have been working on without rigid direction from the top give a higher chance that one of them becomes a real winner. The company, being less structured and with a broad base of skills, is more flexible and can weather external changes better.

Once the company is doing well, maybe stumbling on the next big idea, then it can afford to spend more money to work around the faulty systems. Until then, it has to keep pushing for creative ways to do more with limited and faulty resources.

This is a glimpse into what it's like to have ADHD. The picture includes frustration, the sense of unfulfilled potential, and the struggle to execute tasks. It's not about lack of effort or motivation but about managing a brain where the internal communication system doesn't work as it does for most people. Individuals with ADHD constantly navigate this challenging terrain, showing their resilience and creativity.",13

Minutes feel like months and hours feel like years until eventually my brain decides ""you're okay now"" and I move on to start the cycle over again. Its so exhausting. What makes it worse is when someone tells me that they love me and are obsessed with me and want only me to themselves. To my brain that automatically means they want to be serious and want to be in a relationship forever and they cant possibly be lying cause who would lie about that. But then when reality hits and they leave i go right back to square one of trying to get out of a deep hole that i tried so hard to get out of. There's 1 specific person I've been obsessed with for years. We start off as friends, get intimate, date, then she leaves after telling me to rot in a special place. She's been doing this to me for over a year now. Every single time I take her back cause she apologizes and I forgive her and she tells me she never meant it and she loves me still then she leaves again. Why do I overly obsess over partners? Why can't I be like my friends who don't have adhd and don't get attached so easily?",7
146dk5b,My psychologist says it took long to diagnose me cause I was always considered smart and I was good at masking my symtoms,I got diagnosed at 22 after my memory issues became too bad to ignore. It was only then my psychiatrist started asking me about my childhood and I told her I'd get my work done fast in my earlier schooling days just so I could have an excuse to be outside. And in high school I just wouldn't attend classes but I was still an A student regardless. Does anyone relate?,106
146dd6l,Object impermanence with people,"
I‚Äôve been thinking about how I along with a lot of ADHD and others don‚Äôt really ‚Äòmiss‚Äô people in the same way that NTs do. But as i thought about it, i became a little anxious about something.

It‚Äôs so easy to just forget a person exists if I don‚Äôt see them. Even if it‚Äôs just for a week or even a day, the person just doesn‚Äôt cross my mind often, mostly not at all. I started thinking about what that actually means. Will I just one day forget about everyone in my life once they‚Äôre gone, and I‚Äôll just go on like normal, not ever sparing them a thought or missing them? If I ever get into a long committed relationship and we break up, will I just get up the next day and go on with life like they never happened? What does this mean for my future and what does it say about me as a person?

My grandfather died last year, and I was emotional for a couple weeks tops as i was over at my grandmas a lot and helping prepare for the funeral so there were constant reminders, but after that it all just went away and I went on with life without ever thinking about him or missing him again ever since. I don‚Äôt feel like i miss him and I don‚Äôt think about him often at all. It‚Äôs like he was never there. 

I went on exam leave a month ago and I haven‚Äôt seen much of one of my teachers who i thought I was quite close to. I completely forgot he existed and he just hasn‚Äôt been thought of at all. I don‚Äôt miss him either. I thought I would care just a little bit, but I don‚Äôt feel much at all.

Have any of you guys had similar experiences/thoughts? Had any breakthroughs further down the line that I haven‚Äôt had yet? If so please share.



EDIT: hi I‚Äôm sorry I now know object impermanence IS NOT the correct term, I had heard it from another ADHD community (not on Reddit) and thought that‚Äôs what it was called, sorry if I offended anyone",376

1469vvt,Son newly diagnosed. Would like advice on best way to support him,"Hi all

First time posting here, hope someone can help. My son has recently been diagnosed with ADHD. This is something I've been fighting for years, initially with his dad who insisted he wasn't and then with the school to get him assessed. 

My son is 10, bright, sarcastic, funny and an all out wind up. He is just fantastic is every sense of the word and my absolute little champion. So I'm sure everyone can understand I want the absolute best for him.

My son has little interest in anything other than gaming. We got him a KMX bike as he enjoyed going out on them when we rented them, but typically will choose to stay in if given the choice. 
Tried kick boxing, went for a few weeks then quit.
Tried STEM boxes as shown interest in maths and engineering, doesnt want to do them.
Adores the dog, loves playing with it but again would prefer to stay in than go for a walk with her 
Enjoys swimming though, for now.

I want to encourage and nurture him, help him be the best he can be because he is such an incredible kid but everything I've tried he loses interest in so quickly. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for what might be best suited for him? I thought maybe rugby as he's quick, skinny but tougher than he looks, but there's no rugby clubs for kids in my area.

My son would happily stay in the house all day every day playing games, quite likes board games aswell though,  but ideally need something else.

Any suggestions or ideas or advice. New mum to this and could really do with anything anyone has to offer",8

146avqq,how can I not dread having responsibilities,"I've always dreaded having responsibilities. In school, would procrastinate on doing work until nightfall, then have meltdowns because I didn't have enough time to finish it.

Ever since I came to university it's become so overwhelmingly clear that having  responsibilities literally makes me want to d!e.  I'm so burnt out. The work never ends. There can always be better or more. And even when I cut down on tasks, there's still stuff to do. All I can think about, day and night, is all the things I need to do. And I only think about all the things that can go wrong if I do or don't do them. 

I'm on medication and... congrats, I can focus. But it doesn't take away from the dread of living. I just want to exist, without all this stress and anxiety creeping in the corner. 

I'm currently curating an art exhibition, which is what I wanted for an entire year. I wanted this so much, and now I wake up dreading it, scared that I will ruin it. I know that every job has a ""shit sandwich""/unpleasant side, but I don't know how to deal with any of it. 

And it doesn't stop at work. It's in everything I do. Every hobby, every activity, all day, every day. I literally cannot relax ever. 

I don't know what I could possibly do. It's ruining my life. I ask for help right and centre from ""professionals"", but no one understands. I tried journaling, meditating, yoga, all that. But it doesn't make much of a difference. Does anyone have some actionable advice, or anything at all?",37
1469udf,My father has ADHD and I'm tired of him ignoring me,"Hi. My father has ADHD (not officially diagnosed but my sister graduated in psychology, even though she doesn't work as psychologist and she's sure about it). He doesn't want to get diagnosed because he doesn't believe in psychology nor mental issues.

He's always putting loud videos, changing topics when we talk, suddenly ignoring us, getting mad if we want to watch something he doesn't want to or getting mad if we go somewhere he doesn't want to or when my sister and I are talking, he suddenly interrupts with the most unrelated questions that most of the time makes us mad (like we're talking about going to eat out and he suddenly asks if we did X think we had to do, ruining the mood).

And today I got really tired, I wanted to show him a video I did for my university and I told him I was putting it and he said ""Ok"" and I put it on TV and even before it started, he started watching videos on his phone with volume at max so I paused it and waited for him to stop. I even had time to go play to my phone when like 20 something minutes later he asked me ""Why don't you put that?"" and I was like ""You were watching your phone"" and he was like ""Oh right, put it now then"" and when I put it, he was watching it for a minute and then he got a notification and he started watching his phone again. I took off the video and he didn't even realise until way later.

It stresses me out a lot and I really need help dealing with it. I'm a very patient person, I dealed with my sister having severe depression (she's ok now but she had to go to psychiatrists for 3 years) and I could do it because I learnt how to treat her, what to say and what to not say but I don't know what to do with my dad when it's not what I say the problem but that I'm ignored and interrupted every time I talk.

Do you have any suggestion or tip to deal with it? Or if you have a way you know that catches your attention more. Thank you!",4

1468ve9,ADHD and autism overlap. Do other ADHD‚Äôer‚Äôs also score high on tests for autism?,"I‚Äôm diagnosed with severe ADHD- combined type. I don‚Äôt have any doubts that I have ADHD. 

Recently my life has been pretty hard. I had to deal with some adult problems, that were caused, because of some mental issues I was dealing with. I thought those ‚Äúmental issues‚Äù was symptoms of my ADHD. Apparently they are not common symptoms or even symptoms of ADHD. When I have tried to Google those symptoms, Autism/Asperger comes up. 

I have tried taking multiple different tests that can indicate if you are on the spectrum of autism. My scores turned out very high. I‚Äôm also a young woman, so I tried taking some tests specifically for autism in women and the questions were so much more relatable and the score was high. 

Thing is, I know I don‚Äôt have autism. Even though I definitely have some traits, I don‚Äôt fill out the criteria for an autism diagnosis when it comes to official diagnosis. I also mentioned it for some friends and they said that I was definitely not autistic. That I was too good at understanding other people and myself to have autism. I agree with them on that. I feel guilty, because it made me realise, that I was trying to explain myself and the things I can‚Äôt do, with another diagnosis. I think I just wanted something to help me understand myself better. I have accepted, that it‚Äôs just my personality mixed in with ADHD symptoms. 

Buuuut, I still find it interesting that I could score as high on those tests. Is it a common thing with people with ADHD? If so, it‚Äôs really interesting that autism and ADHD can overlap that muchü§î",16

1468r66,Extreme binge eating problem that keeps getting worse.,"I don't know what to do. When I'm unmedicated, I can't stop obsessing over food. Every minute I'm not eating, I'm thinking about what I'm gonna eat next. I'm an extremely picky eater because of textures and I hate all fruit and veg except for apples, which I can tolerate. 

I'm on 30mg vyvanse and 150mg welbutrin, both appetite supressants, and yet I STILL have a problem. I rely on this medication for it's appetite supressing side effects, because without it I have no control over my food intake. And it never stops.

My entire diet is junk. It's all sugar and carbs, I don't even eat breakfast lunch or dinner anymore, I just snack on trash throughout the day. I can't eat anything else, food just isn't enjoyable unless it's filled with sugar and crap. 

I hardly have any hobbies or interests to begin with because I constantly cycle through hyperfixtations. But even when I am doing something I enjoy, once I start thinking about food it takes over my mind. I can't focus on anything else but eating junk and I won't be able to do or enjoy anything untl I give in and binge on sugary junk.

Like, the mental image of me eating the food will just loop in my head over and over again while a million different reasons for why I should and shouldn't give in are running at the same time. Those thoughts will overpower everything else, making it impossible for me to think or focus.

The loss of the structure of a job has really left me flailing (I don‚Äôt regret retiring AT ALL, though).

Reading is something I did religiously in my youth.  I neglected recreational reading from my teens to my 60‚Äôs - maybe because, as I‚Äôm now discovering, if I don‚Äôt have a test on the material the same day, I retain NONE of it. I understand it and, if it doesn‚Äôt put me to sleep, I can progress (slowly) through it.  But I just picked up a book that I know I at least started, some time ago, and I‚Äôm paging through to try to remember how much of it I read (I thought that I‚Äôd finished it) - and NONE of it sounds familiar.  I remember reading none of it.  

Sometimes that‚Äôs lovely- I can enjoy the same book over and over.  But I‚Äôm doing a lot of ‚Äúself-improvement‚Äù reading and I am coming to the conclusion that it‚Äôs pointless.  If I don‚Äôt remember what I‚Äôm reading, how can it possibly help me?

so i knew a thing about people with adhd and the fact that they can't control the urge to do something for example, not controlling the urge to pop a pimple, biting your nails all the time etc. and I've experienced both of them from a really long time now.

now i think 4-5 years ago i've started to develop a habit of randomly hamming all the time, my parents noticed it and warned me about it. they said if i didn't stop i won't feel any comfort unless i do it and they were right. and after 2 years i think i stopped doing it but it came again and i still do it till this day but less this time. i really can't control it. 

now almost a year ago. every time i went to bed i suddenly can't control the urge to randomly shack my head and it mead me really uncomfortable but again i can't control the  urge to do it. the shacking suddenly changed into a tic expat it was on purpose ( again i can't control the  urge ) and then i started doing sometime new and it is the urge to bang my head mostly my right cheek with my hand. i went to a clinic to check what that is and they told me it might be tourette's ( they did not run any tests or something) i new it wasn't tourette's at all but i was really embarrassed to tell my parents that i do it on purpose so i feel comfortable, just like the humming i mentioned before. i don't do it for attention or shit like that that's embarrassing but rather to feel comfortable ( i don't know how to explain it though) 

i basically can't control the urge to do it but it really bugs me so much and i want that to stop.

1466onk,Do you ever brush aside tasks and struggle to finish them?,"(Diagnosed with ADHD as a teenager when my scores dropped.) I tend to keep aside tasks considering them to be too easy, and forget about them until I barely have any time left. I bullshit through the task and do a horrible job with it and then hate myself for not spending time on it. I loathe myself, and this cycle continues. How do I become more responsible?üò≠",0
1466nwf,Just missed the baby shower for my first Nephew,"It was not at my brother's house, and I forgot to make a note of where it was, when I was told a month ago. 

Come today, I assume it's at his house, I drive an hour to get there, and I find out its 20 min from my house. 

Try to drive back, and the one way toll bridge doesn't accept credit cards, and I don't have a debit card to get cash at an atm. 

So I have to drive another 30 min to a different town to use a different bridge, and see the gps has me arriving after it ends. 

I feel like shit. Like a failure and a terrible brother and future uncle. 


This use to happen more often, but I've gotten better at keeping track of things, making notes. But when I forget to make the note what can I even do.

Part of me is like ""my adhd fuckin sucks, why do I have to deal with this"" and another part is ""I shouldn't make excuses, I'm an adult, to everyone else, it just looks like i'm irresponsible, it wad extremely immature of me to make this mistake.""

I just hope my brother knows that I didn't do this out of lack of care for him and his family. 

 I know normal ppl have an easier time remembering things when they are important. But everything is on the same level for me. It's not that I don't care, but I know it will look that way to other people.

Edit: i want to say thank you yo everyone. I think i was way too hard on myself. My family knows of my adhd and was super understanding when I came after to drop off my gift. It feels kinda silly how sad I got over the situation in hindsight, but in the moment y'alls replies really helped. I may of not responded to all, but I read every one.",106

1465olf,Getting Discipline or Actually Sticking with a Hobby,"I was diagnosed with ADHD inattentive type at  age 29 not long ago. Since then, it's put a lot of things into perspective. The one that bothers me most however, is my inability to commit to something. My whole life I thought it was because I was lazy or stupid or just incapable compared to my peers. Which, internalizing all of that has probably led to my current issues with depression and anxiety.

Like many people here, I've had lots of hobbies. I've just never been able to keep interest long enough to develop any proficiency. This has pretty much led me to having nothing that I actually like doing. I now kind of drift aimlessly without any interests. I essentially have developed a pretty serious case of anhedonia.

But I really want to do something. I've always envied people who had a hobby they committed to for years to the point of actually being proud of it. My longest lasting hobby was guitar. I played for about 3 years before quitting. I've tried drawing, learning a language, programming,(I do this at work, but it's mostly small python scripts. I don't do any home projects.) And many other things It always starts with an intense level of enthusiasm followed by burn out, frustration, and lack of enjoyment.

Does anyone have any advice? Anyone here managed to stick with something? What are some of the things you do to stay committed?Or does ADHD just make me destined to wander aimlessly in search of something I actually like doing? I realize I never actually learned how to be disciplined. I have absolutely no clue how to commit to something. So any advice is appreciated.

tl;dr: struggling to stay committed to a hobby. Have no clue how to even do it. Lack of any interests is a big contributor to my depression/anhedonia. Looking for advice on how others have dealt with this or how others managed to stay disciplined and committed despite ADHD. Techniques? Mental cues? Structure? Anything?",3

1463pw9,Planning out daily routine so that I don‚Äôt get all the dopamine hits early in the day and then feel bored and unmotivated for the rest of it,"When I was younger I used to put off all the things I needed or even wanted to do till the last minute bc it felt like too much of a burden to get started with them.

I started changing this and instead getting in the habit of just starting on one small thing and then once the ball gets rolling, doing all the other things along the way so they would be done and I wouldn‚Äôt need to worry about them. 

I have found this to work well when it comes to tasks I‚Äôm supposed to do that I don‚Äôt really enjoy, or if my general day to day schedule is pretty busy, so that I can get that shit out of the way and then relax or do whatever I want to.

HOWEVER, in the last few years, especially with COVID but even until now, my general day to day life, especially on the weekends, isn‚Äôt very busy, so I end up doing all the stuff more or less at once and feeling a sense of completion. BUT then idk what the hell to do for the rest of the day with all that empty time lol. 

When I was busier, there wouldn‚Äôt be as much empty time, so it was a breath of fresh air and I could fill it how I wanted to with fun things. But now, it‚Äôs like a giant obstacle sometimes, almost, where I get anxious about what to do with it bc I completed all the tasks, and even did a lot of the fun things, all at once, so my brain doesn‚Äôt have a whole lot of dopamine to look forward to for the rest of the day. 

What would be a good suggestion for this?

Maybe only doing 1-2 or just a few things at a time so I still have somewhat of a structure for the rest of the day that I can plan around and enjoy my time around, while remaining motivated?

But not leaving too much off till the last minute to where it backfires and I just feel anxious throughout the day about everything I have to/want to do that‚Äôs coming up?

Just wanted to hear some advice

1463c2l,ADHD and academic writing,"Hello! I was wondering if anyone has any tips for academic writing.

I have ADHD, but luckily I am super interested in what I am studying and even really want to pursue an academic career in the future. However, the problem is...writing. Once I have done all my research, know what I want to argue and the ""real"" writing begins, I immediately lose interest. I guess because it's not ""new"" anymore, or maybe it's fair of failure; probably both. I use ritalin, which helps a lot with reading and other stuff in my life, but somehow this specific thing remains something I procrastinate forever and ever. (it's so strange because I do like writing when it's for myself, and without a plan and the pressure). 

I would really like to find a way to deal with this, because I really love doing research, but this procrastination till the last minute possible makes it quite stressful.  

How do you do this?",31

I will note that I have grown up quite a but since freshman year of college (ended up finishing at a top school) due to faith, mentors, and close friends.

However, I feel like I want to oust any ADHD feeling and feel grounded in what I do on a daily basis.

1462kbm,34 days sober,"I was never one to admit I had a problem or even consider getting sober as an option until I realized alcohol could be the reason for my downfall.. I took stimulants and non and I was either met with suicidal thoughts and even intention or I was met with the med being completely useless so I went untreated for months until I realized my life was in shambles so I told myself ‚Äúwhat I‚Äôm doing isn‚Äôt working so I need to completely change everything and try something different‚Äù so I went cold turkey and that was when I realized I did have a problem but in my new journey I was committed and I was going to stick to it! 
    Stimulation is everything, you get overwhelmed and overstimulated so you drink, you get under stimulation and bored so you seek dopamine in either creating chaos or drinking which in both scenarios are toxic coping mechanisms..
    Living this way through? It wasn‚Äôt working and it just left me in the dark place at the end of the night. That‚Äôs not a way to live your life and you as person deserve more and better. So I decided the only way to make this work is to realize what triggers me and change that..
     People who triggered my RSD had to be out at a distance and kept that way, I had to reconnect with the ones I know truly care, I had to try something different everyday to find that perfect balance. No under or over stimulation was crucial. Find things to feed my dopamine levels but in a healthy way. Writing and not stopping gave me that that sense of accomplishment, cooking and baking amazing food and giving it to others gave me that rush of dopamine due to my people pleasing side but in a positive way. Working out with a goal in mind is giving me motivation and drive for that sense of achievement is giving me large amounts of dopamine and finally being around people who make me happy gave me that dopamine and serotonin boost when life got overwhelming.. 
    50% of addicts are diagnosed with ADHD and I believe that could be higher due to being undiagnosed. We deserve better and life can change for the better. Some days are harder than others but knowing your worth and strength has been the best thing to come out of this. I have faith in myself (sometimes) but I know every day I‚Äôm sober it gives me more faith in my abilities. I was able to restart my treatment, see my therapist regularly and start medication with a clear head..34 days doesn‚Äôt seem long but it‚Äôs been 34 days of my life that I‚Äôve been proud of and I hope those days get longer ‚ù§Ô∏è",9

14627vo,Is this a normal Vyvanse experience?,"Hello! 

I started taking Vyvanse 20 mg starting dose daily in early April. I've had a hard time putting my finger on if it works for me or not. I've previously been on 300 mg Wellbutrin + 18 mg Concerta but I quit both a few years ago. That's a whole story unto itself, but the take away is actually that this combination was super helpful for me. The Concerta really lessened my impulsivity and brought greater calm and organization to my brain. However, reintroduction of Concerta after my long break from it didn't work out. (That's another story.) 

Jumping to the point - Vyvanse 20 mg has helped my motivation and energy but hasn't done much in terms of focus or calm. It also seems to poop out early on some days. I'd even say my focus was somehow worse, fastening too much on details while ignoring the bigger picture... until today. My psychiatrist is wonderful but very pricey. You get what you pay for with her clinic, which is nice, but I am on a budget. I realize you're not supposed to do this,  but I wanted some data for our next appointment so this morning I took 2 x 20 mg  instead of 1 x 20 and it's almost like a different medicine altogether. The calm and quiet mind that Concerta had helped with is there. I can focus on one thing at a time and feel more relaxed, even in my muscles. And the motivation is there. The overwhelm I often feel took a vacation. Noises don't cause the same discomfort. This is completely not what I was expecting. 

Has anyone experienced something similar? I don't want to tell my doctor ""Yeah I tried 40 mg one day and it worked great"" since my script is for 20.(I have some spare days of meds because I've woken up too late on some days to take it.) 

What would kind of suck is if 30 mg felt like an amped version of 20 instead of closer to the experience on 40, if that makes sense. Medications are wild and work in funny ways.

1460vd1,On Prozac and looking into Adderal to further elevate my well-being,"It all started one night, when a big wave of anxiety washed over me followed by a full-on panic attack. I felt like I couldn't control myself anymore, I was terrified. Feeling these emotions for the first time further accentuated my anxiety and the risk of panic attacks in the following days. All this culminated into depression.

Got prescribed Prozac 20mg and I've been on it for about 5 years now. While I've never been depressed since, I still feel anxiety seeping in almost daily, depending on the situation. My mind is always in overdrive.

Today I decided to look into Adderal after reading about it on this sub. I've been coping with untreated (and undiagnosed) ADHD all my life. I'm very impulsive and suffer a great deal from shiny object syndrome, among other things. I jump from one hobby to another without feeling like I'm accomplishing anything. Only getting the initial dopamine hit and then it subsides. Photography, 3D printing, RC cars, miniature printing and painting, coding, VR, and the list goes on. I embrace the new hobby and then, all of a sudden the fun dissipates, never to be touched again. It sucks so bad to realize that most things you own haven't even been used to 20% of their potential.

I feel like my ADHD is a great benefit to my job but outside of that, I feel like I'm never accomplishing anything which is a very unfulfilling feeling.

I've read that taking both Prozac and Adderal isn't a good combo. I wonder if I even need Prozac anymore. In comparison I feel like adderal would benefit me much more based on my symptoms. I just don't want to fall back down the anxiety/panicAttacks/depression spiral if I stop taking it. Especially since it takes like 2 months for the build-up to take effect, if I ever decide to re-take it.

I will need to speak with my doc about it but I wanted to see if anyone has been in the same boat as me, and how it was dealt with.

Thank you",2

I found out that I Love discovering new flavours, new cooking methods, spices, meats. Trying out everything new and exciting but then not loving the final product and hating myself for making so much mess and spending tons of money.

Example: I have found randomly a new recipe that I didnt even considered to be ""great"" tasting for me due to some of the ingredients, but i was excited to try it out. I got out of my house , went to 5 different stores to get all the ingredience, bunch of them in much higher quantities than needed. It took me more than 3 hours to get everything, i spent alot of money, i researched every ingredient that i didnt use before. Every step was a bliss and I was focused. After dreaded 5 hours Ive finally made the dish and it tasted.. OK i guess? Which made me angry for wasting time and money.

- completed tasks leave the list (or move to the bottom)
- master list of tasks, that I can re add when I need to repeat 
- option to set specific time/date/reoccurance 
- option to set open ended 'to do' tasks
- option for other people to add 'optional tasks' to my list (ie, my boyfriend can add 'buy cat food')
- reminders for tasks (optional reminders ideally, like for important or time sensitive tasks)

I don't mind paying if it's really good but I would want a free trial 

I'm in the UK if that makes a difference!

145yvfc,University exams struggling,"Hello!

I usually don't really post on Reddit, so please forgive me if I'm doing something wrong.

So, as the title says, I'm really struggling with university exams right now and I legit don't know how to make it work... Whenever I go sit in front of my books to study, I just look at the book while my mind seems to be doing other stuff. I can't seem to absorb or even read whatever is written in the book, I just sit there doing nothing while my mind wanders off. It kind of feels like it has a queue, and it first needs to empty the queue before it can get to whatever is written in my books.

I've been diagnoses with ADD since I was 7, but never really had an enormous problem with it. Never was medicated because I was apparently a small child and they said it could limit my growth (can't blame the decision of my mom, she's the best and only wanted what was best for me). As a child, my mom pretty much managed my entire life, I had bad grades in school but the only thing I cared about was having fun. Later in high school, the bad grades continued but I didn't really have any ambitions so it didn't bother me too much.

But now... I actually do want to achieve this degree. I don't know what I would do with my life if I couldn't... I just don't know how to get through the exams.

Anyone got a similar experience? And how did you manage to get through it? Is there some way to get your brain to not work against you? Any help would be very welcome!

Thanks!",1
145yui8,I lost a good friend to my memory issues and my inability to listen to conversations,I was talking with a good friend today and I misremembered a key portion of their life which rightfully angered them. I feel like my short term memory is getting worse and I have difficulty listening to conversations. My dad and others have told me that I have trouble actively listening to conversations and I always just passively agree while the information goes in one ear and out the other. What can I do to be a better listener? I feel like the amount of information that's told to me in a given conversation is usually overwhelming unless it's something that I'm extremely interested in. I'm nearly 30 but I feel like I have the memory of an 80 year old with dimentia.,1
145yhun,Keeping my parent house clean,"So I need some advice. I need to get on top of cleaning my parents' home where i live, as it is a mess. Just being in it is overwhelming and gives me decision paralysis because i don't know where to start. Fyi, i am undiagnosed, and so is my mum (i'm currently waiting), but it is very obvious that we both have adhd. We don't clean and if we do its rare when we get hyperfocused or pressured (guests coming over) My dad usually does the cleaning when he is off but he works 60 hours a week and thats not fair for one day of his small amount of free time is taken up with cleaning. Storage in our house is rubbish, furniture and the floor usually becomes our ""storage"". I feel like we should get storage solutions bought and start organising stuff properly so it's not overwhelming, but again, it's not my house. I'll be moving out soonish, so i don't want to spend a chunk of my money on storage furniturethat'ss not even mine.

 Any advice on what to do or how to get started? I might hire a cleaner if things still feel impossible.",2

145xxyk,"I got diagnossed and started meds, it was fast and easy, thanks to this sub :)","Just want to share my history.

-Some months ago I started to feel really bad (always tired, strees, headaches, unable to do anything...) and it was getting worse

-3 weeks ago, I was researching some help to know what was happening me, started to read and watch videos about ADHD, and discovered this subreddit. After a lot of videos and reddit, I started to think I have ADHD.

-Later I went to a psycologist, and just in the second session, he was sure I have ADHD, and told me to go to the Doctor to get meds.

-The next day I went to the Doctor (Not the psycriatist, because I would have to wait 2 months, so I went to normal doctor) Told him what my psycologist told me and just gave me recipe for Concerta.

-In this sub, a lot of people tells that for them it was difficult to get diagnossed and receive meds, but for me it was too easy. No special test or anything, (I'm from Spain) 

- Today is my second day on meds and I feel much better, I have much more energy and I can do things I was unable to do before ( like writing this )

-To finish, just want to say THANK YOU, to everyone on this subreddit, you really helped me.
And if you think you may have ADHD, I recommend you to try to get diagnossed because it can be life changing.

- A bit scared if the meds stop to work someday, but at the moment I am better than ever :)",3

So I was just thinking about my life and was wondering if anyone else is like my and had so many different ideas of what they wanted to do my dream job has changed so much from when I was at school to now. Before I left school I wanted to join the military, then that changed shortly after and I wanted to study electrical engineering, it's what my dad did so thought I could do that, then I studied music then because of all my struggled mentally I started studying psychology. None of these panned out and I floated for a bit I soon found myself thinking it'd be awesome to run my own bar so focused on that for a few months then YouTube and stand up comedy became my main but for the last few years I have had it stuck in my head that I would love to be a chef and when you really look at that you start to realise that none of these career paths have anything in common and I just wondered if anyone else had a similar experience to me. Or on the flip side if anyone has managed to find their dream job and stick with it for the majority.

TL:DR - I have such an eclectic history of chosen career paths and wondered if anyone else was the same or if anyone managed to stay on the same path for their adult life.",1

. 
I'M really struggling here. I'm a 33M who was diagnosed with AdHD when I was 30. I always knew something was off with me but I never knew what it was. I'm a volunteer firefighter and 1 Day my chief had an honest conversation with me that sees potential in me but the I really need to work on simple things that I think everyone here struggles with. (Inturrputing people, slowing down, attention to detail, I could go on but I think everyone here knows what I'm talking about). That conversation hit me hard so I started doing research and when I was finally diagnosed it all made sense. 

Anyway, since ive been diagnosed  I've been on 4 different meds. 2 different antidepressant,  Adderall (nope serve anxiety!) And rittalin, each one has given me different results, and my life has differently approved. I'm supposed to be trying vavyane(spelling?) Once my insure approves it. 

I've been a luckerr on this sub for a long time. And when taken all of these medications I have never experienced that magical clarity that people talk about. Those moments people talk about when first talking medication and everything just makes sense. At least I've never experienced them from medication.

Ever since I was little I've had those moments randomly. I'd just be sitting around and for like 10-15mins everything would just slow down and focus and then bam its gone. With no warning. To this day it still happens. I know what ""normal"" is supposed to be feel like, I just don't know why it happens to me at random times. Even on meds these episodes are completely random
 
I'm worried that I'm chasing this with trying to find my meds. I don't know how to explain it to My doctor because I don't even know how to explain it to myself. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Hopefully this all makes some kind of sense.",1

145w32t,"I like to watch stuff while working, seems like an ADHD thing?","I've noticed since high school that I focus better on a task when my teacher's talking, but they didn't like it when I wasn't paying attention. In university, I'd go to random classes, sit in the last row, and work while the prof talked. Now, I'm working from home as a software engineer and I watch anime or esports while working. Without meds and without a close deadline, watching something is essential to getting work done.

I thought this was normal, since people listen to music while working, but no one I've talked to do this. I read on Reddit recently that ADHD people like to multitask (e.g. browsing Reddit while watching TV), so it makes sense. I get bored too quickly without watching something.

Interestingly, I'm good enough at programming to be able to multitask, but I can't multitask while writing. E.g. I need to pause the videos to write comments or reply to emails. I've been programming since middle school and do it as a hobby in addition to school/work, so I've probably written several times more code than human languages. I'd imagine most people with ADHD who are experienced with their work would benefit from watching something while working.

145vq03,"Overstimulation, alcohol and festivals TLDR","I was diagnosed with combined ADHD a few months ago and have been medicated since. Before medication I drank an insane amount (daily) for 15 years (alongside smoking w*** and taking c***), I would classify myself as an alcoholic, however medication has completly erased my need to drink, in fact I hate it now. It's now obvious drinking was a way of self regulating and I am so thankful I don't feel the need for this any more.

However, without something to highjack my nervous system, I become overstimulated SO easily, primarily by crowds where I end up crying and verging on a panic attack. This has filtered through to other parts of my life and I totalled my car whilst driving and having a panic attack. I'm in therapy for this and in London it's very easy to not have a car.

I was at download festival this weekend, usually one of my favourites, however it is my first time sober and I simply can't cope. I have noise reducing headphones, really understanding and compassionate friends but it's not enough. It's 27 degrees today, there are 100,000 people and the thought alone is bringing me to tears. I cried yesterday and ended up having a pint, feeling a horrid level of drunk but being able to stand the crowds. I don't want that so today I've made the decision to leave.

Does anyone else experience this or have any adice? I am so sad to be leaving but so so SO relieved. I think I'm just sad this is my life now, but I don't ever want to feel like alcohol is going to kill me ever again.

145v1bg,I wanted it to work but Online Community College Sucks,"I'm sick of my online community college classes. It was fine for easier subjects like English and History but for subjects like college level physics, I'm really struggling to see the point of it. The amount of work assigned to me is gargantuan every week and I could either prioritize learning which would mean that my grades would suffer or I could prioritize just doing the stuff required for the exam and learning next to nothing but at least my grades would be there so I can transfer to a university I want. This class is required to fulfill my science with lab requirement and I could have take a lower level class but I don't know whether the university would like that as it's pretty competitive. The worst part of all of this is that I genuinely want to learn physics unlike the other subjects I do sometimes. I told myself I'd prioritize learning rather than just good grades and break the patterns I've had in high school of not learning but it seems like getting good grades and actually learning are 2 very different games that don't always correlate. Plus, the pressure of having to get good grades takes the fun out of learning and I'm learning out of a fear to get good grades rather than because I enjoy it. 

I'm doing a CS degree and it honestly makes me wonder whether the extra cost and fluff of the classes for a CS degree compared to a bootcamp is worth it. I can't do in-person classes for reasons I'd rather not get into and this is simply the most cost-effective way to get a degree.

As soon as I'm not wearing socks, I almost unconsciously start picking at them until they tear or blood flows. For this reason, I almost always wear socks.

My face regularly resembles a minefield from a world war. If I see a pimple, I pick at it until it turns intoa gigantic inflamed crater, even though it was hardly visible before.  I constantly lubricate my lipswith rich lip balms, because as soon as they are the slightest bit dry, I start chewing on them and biting the skin off.

Recently, a new habit has crept in in the form of plucking out hair. Over a period of several hours, I plucked out all the hair on my forearms with tweezers.¬†

When I received my ADHD diagnosis two years ago, my therapist informed me that these habits are enormously common among ADHD sufferers because they are a quick and convenient form of stimulation. I am very ashamed to tell you all this, but I just don't know what else to do. 

I have all these habits reasonably under control, but as soon as I am under stress, they all amplify immeasurably. Right now I'm in my exam period from university and so all these habits are completely out of control.¬†

Then the evening comes, the medicine wears out... All hell breaks loose. 

The panic, the anxiety, the fear; all of the negative emotions come back. Everything seems so overwhelming. Nothing seems possible. Life sucks. 

.

My point is that the medication actually doesn't just help with my motivation to do things but also helps with stabilising my moods and perspectives in a way? Don't know if that's a placebo effect or that's the actual thing. 

But it's interesting how the medicine is acting like a dam - holding out the gushing flows of a whole ocean of emotions - then would break down the moment it wears out.

145rowx,What should meds do for me?,"Hi, I have been diagnosed with ADHD about 2 years ago. The diagnosis also had General Anxiety Disorder in the mix.

My main complaints at the time was around college. I have extreme task aversion. I hyperfocus a lot to the point of not eating. I'm forgetful of things, especially college assignments. Because of the fear of being scolded at or confronted by my professor for lacking requirements I'm almost always absent. I have anxiety over going out as I think people are judging me, etc.

We started on 10mg Ritalin and it worked wonders. I was able to do mundane tasks but still had task aversion especially with college stuff. And the Ritalin wore off at around 3 hrs. We then did 18mg Concerta, still had an aversion but I was able to get more things done. Then we did 27mg and finally 36mg.

At 36mg I noticed the dry mouth/lack of appettite. I was able to focus on a task and do it until its end. I wasn't distracted easily. I still had aversion to college work (I think due to anxiety of doing things perfectly or thinking of having poor grades over the work before I even started).

I told my doctor that 36mg worked great but it worked less and less hours as we progressed. And I still had aversion to college work.

My doctor opted we use Strattera. We started at 25mg and I'm now at 60mg. Overall I felt calmer. And it helped with anxiety a lot. But I don't have the same focused intent as with Concerta. And it doesn't really feel like it's doing anything. I could do college works now but it's at the same level as if I am not medicated. I do it last minute and I tend to get distracted. I can't tell myself ""go do this until finished"" unlike with Concerta.

I told this to my doctor and he told me that even though I am having troubles like last minute doing things, I was doing okay. He said that he can't recommend going back to Concerta since he thinks it only aggravates my anxiety.

I'm at a loss what to do here.",4

145rein,How getting on ADHD medication helped me leave my abusive relationship.,"I (31f) could go into a plethora of details about what type of abuse was occuring but it would be as long winded as my relationship was and wouldn't get any of us anywhere.

This person (30m) and I met organically. They used lots of pitty ploys to get me to drop my defenses and allow them to operate in the way abusers do . 

Being that I come from an abusive upbringing I've always struggled with codependency and wanting to save people. There are 4 trauma responses,"" fight , flight , freeze or fawn."" I am a fawner , that means I go straight into people pleasing mode .
That in combination with having ADHD means I fixate on things that give me dopamine. 

I'll feed into something drastically and sometimes because of my anxiety surrounding the shame I feel about not functioning as well as others I'll sometimes be ""quirky"" . We all remember the kid who was a little hyper and annoying but if they were entertaining we'd put up with them , right ? Pair that with abandonment issues and you've got someone who puts their needs on the back burner for acceptance. 

Well that's who I became into adulthood which honestly doesn't function well in most adult relationships. I tend to isolate myself a bit because for a while I felt a need to be secretive about my taboo choice of profession until I started going back to school (unmedicated, it was so difficult) and learned a skill set & started focusing on who I want to be vs who I was for survival. 

So I find myself in this relationship with someone who was consistently playing into my sensitivities and would intentionally pick fights with me to avoid being held accountable for things. 
Also this gave them the opportunity to become the hero after being the villain seeing as they were the only person that I was getting affection from.

As much as I didn't want to react even though they would instigate I genuinely couldn't help it. When they would break up with me suddenly I would break down crying right then and there and beg them not to leave. Eventually through my own strength and just the monotony of it happening over and over again I wouldn't react as strongly but there were still certain events on the timeline that would trigger me. 

I started my journey in getting a diagnosis over a year ago and it only happened now because I needed somebody who was close to me to tell my therapist what my habits were. Luckily this guy had been living with me so he was able to do it and it's probably the best thing that came from that relationship. I was able to get medicated and the first couple of days it was kind of difficult adjusting.

I had taken this medication as a teenager and a child growing up and I remembered it made me feel very empty inside and I didn't enjoy that but I also lived in a home where I wasn't allowed to have my own identity. 

I began to notice that the lack of feeling anxiety and shame and not being quirky wasn't necessarily a bad thing and genuinely was working in my favor.
I noticed that the things that I got my dopamine fix from we're no longer interesting and I was able to actually focus on what was going on around me.

I decided that this feeling was not me ""lacking something"" but the opportunity to fill it with things that I actually enjoy. Thanks to some research I did on Reddit in regards to side effects of the medicine. I noticed when people suggested to view it in that way and when I did everything changed.
It became extremely apparent that my environment was what amplified the feelings of emptiness , as a child and now .

Cut to the event at hand. There I am in a dispute with this person and he's trying to bait me and antagonize me and all I'm doing is just looking at him and giving clear responses. No emotional outbursts, no fawning, no quirky jokes to lighten the mood.

He starts to say that I am seeming like a very different person. Whilel I do understand that that must be very scary for someone to feel like they're losing a person that they love because they're medicated and it is possible that parts of my personality were manufactured out of survival.

I was still the same person, just less reactive and less accommodating.

I started feeling like I had a superpower and I made sure I took my medicine every day. 
We did have conversations about him feeling uncomfortable and I did try to do other things with him... But the thing is is that he never really got to know me as a person and I wouldn't say that's necessarily my fault it's more that he just wasn't as invested as he claimed to be. 

I truly believe that this medicine gave me the capability to stand up for myself. Of course that means that the abuse started escalating. We did try couples counseling but mainly he's just really obsessed with getting revenge on people and uses justifications to go out and do things behind my back. He was putting my health at risk and was putting me in a financial bind.

Overall we just weren't very compatible and I do have a restraining order against this person now but they still try to contact me and keep trying to remind me about all the fun times we had when I was ""cooking and cleaning for him"".

I have two sets of therapists and I'm working on holding myself accountable for what got me in this situation and how I'm going to process these feelings going forward. 

Throughout a lot of breakups I've had I've fixated on people for an unhealthy amount of time even if they hurt me. But this time I don't feel that way at all and I really do think it's because of my Adderall. I avoided getting medicated and I self-medicated for a long time because my mom used prescriptions as a way to control me growing up. I grew up in a fundamental Christian household which also lends to me being a little naive and vulnerable when it comes to controlling men. I've never considered myself the trad wife type but I've definitely been given the blueprints for it. At this point in life I would love to just move out to the sticks ,be a spinster and adopt a duck, a couple of dogs and take my cats with me but financially that doesn't seem plausible. 

He abused me in every single way that somebody could. I would urge everybody on this planet to read the book ,
""Why does he do that ?"" By Lundy Bancroft. 

P.s. I now have a restraining order against him and luckily when I take my medicine I don't feel like I'm dying inside (because of the separation).

Ltdr: boyfriend's been abusing me for the past year. I'm a typical quirky fawning codependent person. Taking Adderall helped me drop the persona and start taking things more seriously by not allowing me to fixate on the things that gave me dopamine. He said he didn't like who I was becoming because I wasn't reacting to his antagonizing behaviors.",95
145qxi6,Is this part of his ADHD?,"I have really bad OCD that has caused me to be in health hazardous situations often. My partner (who has ADHD) is very loving and comforting if I come to him to talk about it, but he never checks up on me on his own and it feels like he never worries about me in that way. He assures me that he cares about me but he would just prefer it if I came to him first. He hasn't really given a specific reason other than it's hard for him. He's also very forgetful.   


I know that being forgetful is a symptom of ADHD but I'm still having a hard time understanding. It's a pretty severe condition that has threatened my life in some ways, I dont know if this is a selfish question but how is that easy to forget? I dont have ADHD so I dont know. But I am seeking insight from people who do.

It catches me off guard and I‚Äôve heard that dissociation can occur from stress. I am a foreign uni student and stress is an understatement lmao.

145qom8,Adderall making me not thirsty? Is it just me or is this a common occurrence?,"I have heard a lot of mention about cases where Adderall and it‚Äôs generic versions make people very thirsty (I‚Äôd like to note that this is also something I experienced for the first year or so of taking my medication.) However, for the last few years I have been experiencing quite the opposite, dehydration and the symptoms associated with it. I just, don‚Äôt get thirsty, and it is painstakingly difficult to try and force myself to drink water. 

Then on days like today, when I skip a day of medication, I drink like a fish. I simply cannot drink enough. Is anyone experiencing this or have in the past while medicated on Adderall? Or on any other stimulant medication? Or am I just an odd ball? 

I know there was a person here who recently posted about how they forget to drink all the time, and while that is also the case with me, I additionally experience and believe this is just the result of feeling like water is unappealing to me, and find it hard to consume throughout the day. 

I realize that this most likely has negative effects on my general health, and the only thing I can find to combat this is drinking electrolyte beverages as much as possible. That all being said, soda and any flavored drinks go down fine, so I find this particularly odd tbh.

145qgn1,Vision/hearing reduced by ADHD shutdown?,"I've been reading up on ADHD shutdown, something I experience often when confronted with an overload of emotions/thoughts/stimuli. It's most often described as a state where one finds difficulty moving, speaking, or expressing thoughts due to an overwhelm in the mind. For me, my face falls blank, I find it hard or impossible to emote, speak, move, or think a single clear thought, usually for 15 minutes or a little longer (depending on the situation).

One thing I haven't seen discussed is vision/hearing loss during these shutdowns. I find that my surroundings get significantly quieter, I struggle hearing or making sense of noises around me, and often my ability to focus my eyes on my surrounds is reduced as well, making everything blurry. My hearing and vision are both 100% fine according to regular check-ups, never had any concerns with either. These symptoms only occur during a shutdown, I was wondering if anyone else experiences this too?

My guess would be that it's due to the overstimulation in my brain limiting it's ability to process external stimuli properly.",3
145qbgs,why am i so emotional,"little things set me off and idk why, it‚Äôs getting bad and it‚Äôs so frustrating bc i just keep ruining the mood with me getting emotional. i can‚Äôt even say what the things that set me off are, it‚Äôs so random. but if my brain decides it doesn‚Äôt like whatever just happened there‚Äôs nothing i can do but let it pass. 

it‚Äôs not even that i feel angry and sad particularly, just emotional if that makes sense. like i can‚Äôt pinpoint the exact emotion, i just know i feel emotional and like i‚Äôm gonna explode with it. i feel overwhelmed i guess. i have to go to my room and let it all out and cry, i hit myself and pull my hair sometimes too, it helps. when it happens around my mom it comes out as anger and i get all defensive, but thing is i‚Äôm not actually mad. idk what that means. 

also, i only ever show myself getting worked in front of my mom. if it‚Äôs in front of other people i can hold it in and act fairly normal, but i think maybe that‚Äôs something to do with my social anxiety, and i‚Äôm more comfortable around my mom. but then why can‚Äôt i just always keep it together? i don‚Äôt know if this is adhd or something else.",3
145qb21,"""Argumentative"" cycle","Over the past year or so I've had people close to me mention that I'm argumentative, or I've noticed shifts in our relationship due to them expecting some kind of confrontation. It's incredibly frustrating and hard to work through because the majority of the time, im not intending to be argumentative. Combine that with being perceived as self-absorbed and cue the shame spiral. 

My intention for writing this is to get some kind of help on how to go about this. I've noticed it degrade my relationships and it feels like I'm stuck at a wall I can't move past, it's infuriating to realize I've circled around again to the same issue and had no idea. ( I would also be curious if anyone experiences this as well)

Some things I've noticed seem to be argumentative; 

- when I get passionate about something and want to express my thought, if someone doesn't seem to understand i'll interject with ""no, but--"" to continue it. Not to disclaim their thought, but to say "" that makes sense, but what im getting at is--"" without thinking to just say that. ( or similar phrases)

- countering someones opinion on something to attempt and connect with them. ( esp if its the only thing i can think of to say relating to the topic.) Or, to give a different perspective in hopes I'll get more understanding on their thoughts for conversation sake. 

- tone, volume, or body language when I get excited to talk about something.

- not understanding where the line is between "" accept what they say and move on"" and "" express your beliefs and stand up for yourself"".  I don't want to get steam rolled and be a pushover, but i dont want to be overly assertive either. 

- getting frustrated when I'm not being understood and ""arguing"" my point of view/feelings because I want to be heard, not because i think they're wrong.",5

i feel like everything just confirms my feelings. i have been dumped multiple times by people i thought really liked me, been cheated on, i'm the only one ever initiating stuff with anyone, and i always feel like a second (or last) best option. it's kind of just a feeling that's always in the back of my mind no matter how much i try to talk myself out of it. i know that it's the reason for a lot of my struggles.

145o8pf,What's your self-talk after doing anything/accomplishing a task?," I'd like to work on self-talk and encouraging myself. Does anyone have phrases I could remember to say to myself or something to bring into my consciousness and awareness that ""Hey! Wake up you! You did a thing! Good job"" ... but a little more than just that. I feel like most of my life in order to survive I just roll with the punches and get on with it. But being a human is exhausting on all accounts, and it's a big deal when we get things done. And so often I think the route my brain takes to complete a task is to just do and not think, which can be helpful in terms of maybe getting something done, but also at the same time makes me feel like a zombie or brainless rat in the rat race of life... It's boring and I don't want to be boring with myself anymore. I want to use even mindless tasks to be more mindful. So how do I reward and encourage my ""internal side"" to give myself the recognition instead of just mindlessly making myself do something I have to do and moving on without a thought or care... and then that task never getting solidified as an accomplishment in my memory. I hope this is making sense.  
I am curious what do you say to yourselves to give yourself that full dopamine hit after completing something you were working on? I get mixed up with my thoughts and have a hard time with feelings so curious if it's more of a thought or a feeling of accomplishment or how to get the best of both with this.

145li59,I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE Due APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Bruhhhhhhh lemme tell you something. I downloaded Due not long ago because I read somewhere about it being great for people with ADHD. 

This damn thing harasses you about any and all chores/errands/etc until you swipe them away. 

I‚Äôve always had an issue with alarms because they‚Äôll go off continuously until I silence them and forget they existed. 

With Due, you can set how often it reminds you to do something!!!! Want reminders every hour until you mark it complete? Cool. Every 10 minutes? Sure. No constant, loud ass beeping like an alarm does. 

If I‚Äôm in the middle of doing something and Due sends a notification, I can keep doing whatever I‚Äôm doing but be reminded I have something else to do. In the middle of a game and can‚Äôt save yet but have to do dishes? Due will let you know every 30 minutes. You can try to find a save point in the meantime üò≠ I love it. 

And yeah I sometimes let Due send me stuff for days until I feel like doing it. Notifications can be silent. But every time I look at my phone, I‚Äôll see Due there telling me I have stuff to do until I do it. No more ‚Äúoh I forgot oops.‚Äù

145l9sz,Dexedrine Spansule XR Not Being Made Anymore?,"Wondering if anyone on Spansule XR(or generic dextroamphetamine XR) has been able to refill it recently? My doctor warned me in January 2023 that I was not going to be able to continue with it because they were going to ""stop making it"".

However, I'm not able to find any information that corroborates production has ceased completely. Does anyone know if it really is gone forever?",4
145l93p,Is it anhedonia or I'm just bored?,"I thought for a long time I experienced anhedonia, but given the prospect I possibly have ADD (I'm commencing a clynical treatment but I haven't been diagnosed by my psychiatrist yet, as she's waiting for my anxiety leves to lower down and make an appointment with a neuropsychologist), things seem different now. What is the difference between being blatantly bored and being unable to enjoy almost every activity I engage in?

I do not mean by this that they're the same, but ask whether they are similar or I am just confused.

I can perceive physical pleasure, but most of the things I enjoyed I simply don't anymore. Most of the times I can't tolerate music (even though I am preparing myself to be a professional musician), but maybe the feeling (I didn't know to adress) was boredom. It's most likely I have ADD, but there are symtomps I can't fully relate to. Being bored is one of them, as I'm always in a rush, but is it possible that my lack of pleasure is due  to ADD (by itself or because of the anxiety ADD entails)?

Does anybody feel the same?",4
145kvjb,Non stimulant ADHD medication,"So I live in Morocco where stimulants are illegal and can‚Äôt even be found in the underground market and most people have never heard of them. So far adderall worked best for me, Ritalin worked but as well and concerta felt like taking vitamin pills (basically nothing) unless I took a minimum of 2 36mg pills long acting which is a bit too much in my eyes. 
When I got to Morocco I have tried every possible way to get my hands on any kind of stimulant drug but failed. Therefore I decided to try out Wellbutrin which was a first week of complete and utter hell then it worked although I didn‚Äôt feel it work people around me noticed though and after 3months I was back to my normal adhd self. I am super hyperactive and have very little impulse control.. I have learnt to focus over the years but I have to either like what I‚Äôm doing or really put the effort to. 
I am now looking for other substances I can try out and it doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre not a second line treatment as long as they work. I want to start Strattera but I costs an arm and a leg here and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to afford it every month. Chlonidine is available in Morocco without prescription needed so I‚Äôll give that a try but I‚Äôm a bit scared about my blood pressure since I already have a pretty low blood pressure rate. Guancafine isn‚Äôt available in Morocco either. 
Does anyone have any other suggestions? I will literally give anything a try because of the nature of my job. I‚Äôm an HR executive who can‚Äôt keep my mouth shut or stay in her office for longer than 30min and that‚Äôs a problem that can make me lose my job so I am taking any and all suggestions no matter how far fetched they can be.",3

145kfwv,Medication resources.,"Okay so this is a weird one. Sorry if it's formatted wonky, I am on mobile. My primary care doctor moved out of state. None of the other providers in his clinic are taking new patients. As soon as I learned of this, in April, I set up a new patient appointment within a different local medical system, but they couldn't get me in until October 3. I was told when I made that appointment that I should go to urgent care in the meantime to get my script filled. 

I currently have five days of medication left,  so I made an appointment and went into Urgent Care yesterday. They told me that adderall is a controlled substance and could not be prescribed in an Urgent Care setting. They suggested that I should try going to the ER, but my ER copay is $250, and I do not have the budget for that every month. 

So I called the clinic my doctor was at and they were willing to fill the prescription one time but not again and told me that I needed to get a new PCP. Which I have. But I can't see her until October.

145jqmi,Anyone any experience with Intuniv or Atomoxetine?,"Hi all, 

I need some help to decide whether I want to start either Intuniv (Guanfacine) or Atomoxetine. If anyone has taken any of those, can you share a bit about your experience and whether they were helpful (and how) or whether they didn‚Äôt work for you or just made things worse? I‚Äôm especially a bit cautious of Atomoxetine as its supposed to work like an anti-depressant/anti-anxiety drug. And then Intuniv has sedative effects, which I really am not sure of. 

I‚Äôm a 28yr old female, have been diagnosed late in life (24) and I just immediately started on dexamphetamine, I only used to use 7,5mg twice a day to study before exams. So it was only 2 weeks at a time. Now I use it daily for work, 2,5mg twice daily. The reason why the doctor want me to try another drug is because I often feel very overwhelmed and can get sensory overload. My mind doesn‚Äôt get quiet like other people describe. The 2,5mg dose isn‚Äôt really as effective as 7,5mg but I just couldn‚Äôt deal with the side-effects at that dose. And I also have a bit of anxiety and depression going on so at first he wanted me to try medikinetXL, which is Methlyfenidate but then I brought up the non stimulant (because of feeling overwhelmed and overloaded) and this were the other options. 

I know different things work for different people but I really have no idea how I feel about trying these. I‚Äôm mainly scared it will fuck me up mentally and make things worse and I still won‚Äôt be able to focus. But I actually have no idea how these drugs are supposed to work or have affected people. Please don‚Äôt see this as advising me anything, I just want to read more about your experiences. It would really help me.

Thanks guys",1
145jlhj,why I'm trying to limit the internet,"I'm new to using reddit and I can be super messy with my writing. I also don't know if this is a common mindset to this group because this is the first time I've actually spoken to a bunch of adhd people.

you should probably read this post from the perspective of a young adult male who only just got diagnosed with adhd after a long battle with a not-informed medical service. adhd has driven me in circles my whole life but I would be treated like it was something else so I got put on tons of different medication and always thought I was just crazy.

to start, im going to differentiate ""digital information"" and ""physical information"". when I was a kid we didn't have the internet, but we had a computer we could play games off of disc or movies and basic tool stuff. digital information is pretty easy to explain, its any information/entertainment you get off of a screen. physical information is focus tasks you can do with your hands like painting, stacking or folding things, whatever exercise you like, etc. I still like setting up tea parties because its a no pressure but detail focus task where I can set everything just as I like it.

a Wi-Fi connection, and unlimited access to using the internet, I think has caused my head to de-rail for the past decade. at first my family and myself thought the issue was the computer itself, just like how you'd blame the TV, not the content being watched. But without a Wi-Fi connection, your ""digital information"" has a strict ceiling, you may have months or weeks before you get a new movie or videogame. with the internet, the ceiling is just gone and now you have a constant downpour going in of constant information. twitter posts, YouTube drama, someone fighting with you about some pointless topic, politics, theories, scary things and very very exciting things. There is no way to calmly pick through this information and decide which you want as your entertainment for the week.

I am incredibly exhausted by it, yet I feel so strongly attached to the constant stream of new information that it's been near impossible to try control it. It has caused me so much anxiety, keeping my messaging apps open to make sure that everyone likes me and is okay and that I'm not missing anything. I would check my phone constantly, and often send a huge pile of messages to people if I felt I had to defend or explain myself. I would make sure to watch every video about the current drama topic about some person who did a thing online that honestly, will never affect me personally. I'm not an American, I'm an islander living in the rural forest area, but I was swept up with the 2016 election and it changed a lot of how I consume information. 

I'm sort of at the belief now that some adhd people, or adhd in general, is just not able to handle a constant internet connection. It's hard to say this to people, as now the internet is seen as a basic need like water or heating. I see people blame a lot of things, but never their own personal use of the internet. I'm thinking, how did I even come up with all these huge, miserable ideas and obligations? why do I make myself sick for the sake of constantly being online and keeping up with daily events and drama.

deleting twitter and removing the app from my phone was very difficult to get used to but I instantly felt some relief, and noticed, with a little shock, that I had stopped ""writing tweets in my head"". I used twitter for 3 years constantly and when I was doing tasks or experiencing things, my inner voice would start to write out a tweet, trying to summarise the event or task in the character limit of a tweet. When i took away the ability to tweet at all, I started to not hear that commentary and just sat through things as they were happening. 

but ""deleting twitter"" isn't solving the problem for me. It's constant messaging apps where I have to talk to people, its steam and videogame online where I buy a bunch of games that I really like the look of and then never open them once. its YouTube, where I get very long videos about stressful topics that I don't really need to know about. even the radio with its news reads and ads I've noticed are too much different random information for me to handle.

I genuinely miss having the ceiling on, when I would watch a movie from my DVD collection and it'd be the same movie I've watched 40 times before. I would play Minecraft and build something that took a week to finish because I didn't have anything else to play. The same book I've read since I was young, so that I get to re-read pieces slower, enjoy their form and technique and not feel bogged down by the huge amount of un-read story.

I think many of you will understand how I feel when I play online games. Overloaded by the chat and demands of other players harassing me for not understanding the map layout or objective. when I bump into someone ingame I apologise and run away from them. once again I would be excluded from a group activity because I just wasn't on the same level as the other players.

I think it might be time to limit the days I use the internet to maybe 3 days a week, or work towards that, and have a plan for what I want to use the internet for. go online for a research task, then turn it off once I've gotten what I want. because its not the computer thats bad- I love making music, drawing, playing games, using programs like dosbox and figuring out how to do basic computer tasks.

this is really scary to me, as I don't have friends irl (but I never did to start haha) and the only comfort I got was from the internet- but the cons outweigh the pros like a whole bunch of elephants weigh up to a single cup of milkshake (even if that milkshake has a lot of tasty things on top).

Well I did hear that some adhd folks have the power to stay calm or in controll in extreme situations because of whatever reason. I dont want so say something wrong. I feel like this has something to do with it.

But basically ever since I could think of I was a junkie for epic movies and extreme activities.

As a child I always wished some Shield Agend would knock at my door and tell me that I have super powers. I dreamt of having to save the whole world and basically being close to losing my life while doing so.

I simply didnt want to live in the boring reality.

But I am still here so I guess I came to senses somehow but I cant stop myself from thinking exacly that after seeing some epic movies or (when I still read) books.

I am pretty reckless when it comes to more scarier stuff. I never understood how my friends didnt fight with me over the VR glasses in that horror escaperoom we were at. Of course it was scary but the shock and the fear made me feel so... idk. Okay. I liked it!

Superhero stories or things like that throw me off of my tracks just like the death of my father did. I am not kidding. Maybe not as extreme but this is exacly how lost I felt after it. Just because its over and I now have to come to terms with going to work the next day or prepearing food or some boring everyday stuff.

I just saw the masterpiece that Spiderman - Across the Spiderverse is, I am 22 and dont know what to do with myself now.

Have had a few fights with my girlfriend recently where she pointed out that I'm often not actually present in a conversation. Best way to describe it is I'm hearing, but I'm not listening. I can see that I do it in hindsight, but I don't see it in the moment it's happening, because I'm too wrapped up in whatever is going on in my head, whether it be formulating replies to a sentence she hasn't even finished, or thinking along a tangent based on something she said and then not really paying attention to the rest?

145hkzm,The relationship between ADHD & C-PTSD,"*I want to start by making it clear that the intention of this post is to explore the relationship between ADHD & C-PTSD (Complex PTSD). I haven't explored the topic in depth, and am hoping to gain a better understanding of how the two are related, how they present and ultimately how this affects diagnosis and treatment.*

**Basically**

It is possible for C-PTSD experienced during childhood to manifest as symptoms resembling ADHD in adolescence/adulthood. Childhood trauma, such as chronic abuse, neglect, or witnessing violence, can have long-lasting effects on an individual's psychological and emotional well-being.

When children experience trauma, it can disrupt their development and impact various aspects of their functioning, including attention, behavior, and cognitive abilities. This disruption can lead to difficulties with concentration, impulse control, and hyperactivity‚Äîsymptoms commonly associated with ADHD.

However, it's important to note that these ADHD-like symptoms arising from childhood trauma are not true ADHD but rather a result of the traumatic experiences. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as ""pseudo-ADHD"" or ""trauma-induced ADHD.""

Here are some key points to consider regarding C-PTSD in childhood and its potential link to adult ADHD-like symptoms:

**-** Overlapping symptoms: As mentioned earlier, ADHD and C-PTSD share symptoms such as inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Childhood trauma can contribute to the development of these symptoms, which may persist into adulthood.

**-** Developmental impact: Trauma experienced during critical periods of brain development can affect cognitive functioning and executive skills. These disruptions can mimic ADHD symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis.

**-** Emotional dysregulation: Both childhood trauma and ADHD can lead to difficulties with emotional regulation. Emotional dysregulation resulting from trauma can be misinterpreted as ADHD-related impulsivity or mood instability.""

**So**

How likely do you think it is that there are people out there who have C-PTSD, and ADHD-like symptoms, but not ADHD? How might this affect diagnosis & treatment? How might this explain the vastly growing number of ADHD diagnosis'? Does this explain why ADHD medication may be effective for some, but not others with the same diagnosis?

If you made it this far thanks for reading, I am very interested in hearing anyones ideas or personal experiences on the topic.

145hctq,Advice on finding success in jobs that require you to interact with people in a way contrary to how you've built your social interaction skills?,"Like many people with ADHD, as a child I was forced to take an active role in learning how to be socially adept, how to read people, how to connect easier, how to understand and respect others' boundaries/comfort/space. 

I have a ton of electronics repair experience, I've worked at many cell phone repair places, and I just got a job as a manager of a new location in a small business. Because it's a fairly new company, for the next few months it's looking like I will be doing very few repair jobs, and instead I'm the sole person responsible for making sales at this location, selling unlocked phones and phone plans. 

This is a fantastic opportunity for me. I've never had a managerial job before, but I felt confident that I knew the industry enough to navigate the responsibilities of the job. HOWEVER, my personality and heavily-prided social skills are all geared towards allowing people their own space, allowing people to be in control of the flow of conversations, allowing people to make their own decisions and to have patience when I might have an answer or sentence queued up while someone is thinking.

So far, I feel like an absolute failure in the sales industry. I am doing my best to learn the tactics, learn how to smoothly upsell, how to find options that benefit both customers and company. I don't even feel scummy with the concept of sales, as the owner of the company/person who hired me, is authentically a non-scammy person who is just trying to maintain a healthy business and grow as much as possible. 

Yet, no matter what I try, even when I'm anticipating that I might lock up in a sales pitch when a person balks, even when I prepare myself to be pushy or convincing or whatever, I simply can't keep my wits about me. I give up the chase too quickly, I wuss out of upselling or adding accessories, I continue to try and cut deals or make allowances \*when they're honestly not needed\*.

This job is a great opportunity, even if I don't stick with it, the longer that I can show that I worked as a manager on my resume, the more opportunities I have going forward. I have talked with the owner about how I used to feel bad about sales because I feel like I'm digging for customer's money, but he worked with me to change my perspective, and see it in a new light: If a customer is better off, if they have the means, then it's simply smart to give them greater options. If a customer has a tight wallet, it's okay to cut deals or even outright sell products below cost, where we're losing money in order to help a customer out.

Does anyone have insight or advice on how I can fight my social nature and improve in this way? I can't stand the idea that I lose out on future repair opportunities, future managerial opportunities, not to mention the income, all because I couldn't do sales.",1

But today she is very upset with me because I told her I would grab some ointment for a giant scrape she just got on her arm and I constantly forgot to do so, even after promising I would do it.

We work together and she came and checked on me multiple times to see if I had grabbed it yet, but I constantly forgot and/or was distracted by coworkers, or actual work so she finally just went and got it herself. I saw her walk out the door and was instantly reminded of my failure to remember to grab it for her, because it was obvious that's why she was leaving the office and I sent her a text right away apologizing for forgetting constantly.

She's upset because she says she feels unimportant to me, but I love her very much and am a slave to my shitty, forgetful and easily distracted brain.... 

This is not the first time I've gotten in trouble for this sort of situation (with multiple partners) and it feels impossible to say anything without sounding like I'm just making excuses for my failures, or ""making it about me""... 

I have no idea what kind of advice or help I need, but if anyone has anything, I'd appreciate it because I'm kinda caving in on myself here... We both struggle with avoidant tendencies when we're upset about something and I'm having a hard time fighting the urge to just walk/run away from a relationship I care about... But I really hate feeling like I'll always just be a disappointment, no matter how hard I try.

I'm 40 years old and struggling to come to terms with just how much ADHD has messed with my past (before I knew I had ADHD) and apparently my future, it's hard to keep my head up and keep going...",2

In the younger ages it would be the hyper bouncing off the walls energy with hyper focus on things that didn‚Äôt really matter. As I aged, my symptoms changed such as experiencing periods of anxiety, depression, and dissociation from the stress that came with. After being diagnosed and treated, life has changed. I tried lexapro and wellbutrin which honestly both made my ADHD worse. Rittled with anxiety in my life, I was reluctant to try a stimulant but boy am I glad I did. Even on the lowest dose (10 Mg), vyvanse has done nothing but good for me. Anxiety, fatigue, mood swings, brain fog have all seemed to lift. It‚Äôs easier to wake up and look forward to the day.

145f538,What are your best tips to overcome brainfog/inattentiveness?,"I noticed that if I miss any of these things, then meds hardly work. 

But when I have all these things down, my meds actually work, and even If I don't take them, my energy/focus goes way up.

1. **Good sleep  -** this is absolutely critical. Without good sleep, the effectiveness of meds essentially is cut down by 90%.
2. **Drink water -** when dehydrated, brain fog comes in full force
3. **EAT something, especially breakfast (preferably protein/fats rather than sugar/carbs) -** I noticed that when I don't eat breakfast, then I'm much more foggy brained. I learned this from Jordan Peterson when he mentioned that if you don't eat breakfast, then your blood sugar levels go out of whack - which spikes anxiety. This is definitely true in my experience.

**Supplements** \- I always take b12, b1, and alpha gpc supplements which somewhat help with my focus, memory, verbal recall, etc but I'm not 100% confident with how much they help. This is still up in the air and I'll need to do more experimentation.

Some things that aren't as effective in my experience: 

1. exercise (i do this almost everyday, and i honestly don't notice a difference in mental cognition. but it's GREAT for sleep and physical health). 
2. meditation (to be fair, i'm just referring to meditation in the short term. after one session, i feel more calm/stable, but i don't notice a sharp increase in focus - but it may have more cumulative/compounding effects over the long run)",1

I recognize my experience is purely my own, so in support of making the project successful, I would love a diverse understanding and scope of experiences ‚Äî feel free to share any other identities of yours in your response as well (ie. race, religion, gender, sexuality, ability-differences, etc)


A few general questions that may help outline your experience:

1. What is your biggest challenge/road block when it comes to meditation

2. Do you attribute this challenge (question 1) to your ADHD identity? In full, partially, or not at all?

3. Share any times you‚Äôve found ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù in your meditation practice, and if you‚Äôre willing, I‚Äôd love to understand what success in this context means to you

145elko,I just need some advice..,"I don't know what to do anymore besides maybe medication, but my brain has been a real meany in the last few months. I have always kind of joked for lack of a better term about potentially having ADHD but wrote it off always as nothing too serious. I have never been officially diagnosed but over time through research and reading firsthand accounts that almost make me cry because it describes me to a ""T"". 

After me and my ex split over a year ago the era of living completely alone besides days, I have my daughter began. Nothing seemed different until maybe 6 months ago. Coincidentally this was around the time my small group of very close friends just kind of disbanded. It was a slow process, but life just happens. I naturally just started spending a lot of time alone. I have developed some weird tendencies which ultimately led me to wondering if maybe this was actually an issue that needed to be address. 

I feel like my brain is moving so fast that its slow. There will be times I walk back and forth in my house multiple times because ""Oh I forgot my keys!"" then walk back to the door only to realize ""Shit I don't have my wallet."" Walk back to get said wallet and then FORGET WHY I CAME IN THE ROOM. I physically have to stop, focus, and most times I remember. I have just broken down and cried in the middle of it from just sheer frustration. 

I have a hard time being in conversations too especially if I am in an environment where energy is high. I interject a lot and the split second after I do it I feel ashamed because I hate when people do that to me but I can't help the fact that if someone brings something up and god forbid I know anything about it, I just spew. Same with most other things like this post for example. I feel like I could go on forever and there are other things too. I make up imaginary conversations in my head all the time.

I know I need to see a doctor or something but the reason for this post was to A.) vent a little, I don't know how to talk about this to someone without my words sounding like a jumbled mess with it all trying to come out at the same time so this was my alternative and B.) maybe find some ways everyone else copes?

145ed9g,For people who hate shaving their legs- try bleaching! Another tip for getting out of the house.,"I started bleaching my leg hair, and I love it. 

For personal reasons I wanted to stop shaving my legs, but was still really self conscious about my leg hair as it is really dark and rather thick. I started bleaching it, I just use the only stuff I can seem to find (Jolene cream bleach), and love how low effort it is compared to shaving.

I used to *hate* shaving my legs, in part because I have really sensitive skin and hair that grows really fast, and because it was one more really time consuming, energy zapping thing I felt like I *had* to do before I could go out in public.

Anyway, I'm sure bleaching leg hair wouldn't suit everyone for lots of reasons, but for anyone who feels like trying it, I highly recommend. Instead of spending a ton on extra expensive blades for sensitive skin, and all that time actually shaving, and having that be one more monumental hurdle to get out of the house, now I just mix up and apply some bleach once a week or so.

I feel like I have a fuzzy golden halo around my legs, and it is a great middle ground for me as someone who hated shaving for aforementioned reasons, and also for the social pressure and expectations bit,  like my body is 'gross' and not socially acceptable as it is. (Women shouldn't feel like they *'must'* shave, it should be a choice. But if we can't choose otherwise without being socially ostracized or feeling shitty and self conscious because of the social pressure and expectations, then it doesn't really feel like a choice.
Anyway, that's a whole other rant for another sub üòÖ)

Just thought I would share, as it has been a game changer for me, as one less thing I need to do to get out in warmer weather.  And a great middle ground between not shaving and feeling self conscious about my dark leg hair. 

*One of the hassles of this, is you don't get the full benefit of this scheme until your leg hair is fully grown out. You can still do it as it is growing longer, but the best is once your hair is all grown in and then you're just doing more of a maintenance bleach to match the slower growth, instead of trying to keep up with the leg hair roots that keep on growing out. But again, my leg hair grows really fast, so this would probably be less of an for lots of peeps, especially anyone with lighter/ finer/ less abundant hair. (I used to shave in the morning and by midday feel like I wanted to shave again, my hair grew so fast. And eff goosebumps! )",2

I‚Äôve had some interesting anxiety for the last 2 months about my girlfriend and inevitably broke up with her after telling her the anxiety of us being happy long term scared me and the whole notion of actually moving forward with her was intimidating. 
I then sent myself into one of the worst depressive episodes I‚Äôve ever had where I started questioning who I am and almost guilting myself for hanging with friends/ enjoying the things I used to enjoy‚Ä¶ etc. I stumbled upon this Reddit page and it‚Äôs all my brain has been able to hyperfocus on. I recently got diagnosed with ADHD and it‚Äôs made life a lot more understandable for me. Im a fairly healthy male I would say. 24 6‚Äô1 and weigh 190lb. In desperation to control my thoughts and anxiety I spent so much time reading how meds has helped a lot of people: I believe it is necessary. The biggest question for me is it worth it to start or with the influx of all my current emotions guiding me to start a path I may regret later. I‚Äôve always been worried about any types of meds as I believe I am able to go without and can cope without. I come from Asian decent so my family has always taken the holistic route. I have never went to therapy up until recently and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always wanted to try. The thing is I would love to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I‚Äôve always had trouble with attention and always had trouble with being in the moment at times so I figure meds could help. But then I read about how most ppl on meds are trying to cycle off of them as they‚Äôve gone too dependent. I picked up my prescription but I‚Äôm extremely anxious to even try this trail run. It‚Äôs almost scary to think that I‚Äôm now bound to meds to function. 
I have a great job although I am not performing to par. I have great friends who genuinely have love for me and I don‚Äôt have any other health conditions so I‚Äôm blessed in that manner and will always be humble in the regards that there are people who genuinely need more help than I do. For me the biggest issue is my mind - I can‚Äôt control it. I‚Äôm reaching out to learn more about what some of you guys think. 

Is the holistic route worth it? Is adhd crippling without medication? How long do I have to use the meds? Do I actually need meds to be successful? Has CBT therapy alone worked for people? Has anyone had a solid relationship with their S/O without use medication? Can I live a happy life without meds?

Usually I would get frustrated in a situation like this about someone ‚Äònagging‚Äô me and then feel extremely guilty about letting people down but looking at the bigger picture this situation isn't deep and I've learned that people really don't know everything that's going on and you also don't have to explain yourself to people.

145cwa2,I sat down to try and unravel the mestery of me,"So I'm sudanese, 23 and in egypt fleeing war right now. My whole life was just weird encounters, pathological shyness, and(which both led to) being ostracized. I had a feeling this might be a mental disorder of some kind but never let it decide my life for me and kept trying the hardest however I could, but to no avail.

With the growing popularity of ADHD on tiktok for raising awareness on the matter, I started getting curious and took an online test that I'm highly likely to be diagnosed with ADHD and while it would explain a LOT of stuff, most of which is my inability to have proper sleep, I feel it might just get worse in the future.



I'm already considered an outcast and it won't change soon, so minimal losses right now. But how do I live with it and at least minimize symptoms? Life's already hell for, me and while I know it only gets worse, it's not gonna be something I can take care of alone. And it'd be nice to know when to say what.",1

145bx7n,Question Re: my kid's experience with Adderall,"If reading about potential side effects could bother you... please stop reading here.

My kid (14) was officially diagnosed with ADHD-C a little over a year ago.  We knew it forever, but we had gone to 3 different experts who advised against medication.  (Part of the problem was that he falls into the 2E category and did exceptionally well on whatever cognitive assessment they could throw at him.  Long story short, Covid lockdowns worked out best for him b/c in person school was a disaster for him due to distracting other students, annoying teachers with constant interruptions, etc.  He's been full time remote since.  

However, when the kid came to me and said he really needed something to help, we went to an ADHD clinic, where we knew they wouldn't hesitate to offer medication.  Our insurance forced us through the circuit of ALL the stimulants.  Concerta, Vyvanse and one other were all not good for him.  They made him tired and then he had a hard crash in the afternoon where he became moody (understatement).  Ultimately Adderall kinda worked (20 mg XR).  I say kinda b/c it still makes him tired, but he is able to concentrate better, didn't have a major crash, got all A's in his first year of high school, but he really doesn't like taking it, b/c it makes him tired, so he doesn't take it when not in school.

A few months ago I noticed one evening his feet were BRIGHT RED (as if sunburned).  He told me it had been happening for a while (basically since he started Adderall) but they didn't hurt or anything.  His regular pediatrician was out of town, so we got an emergency visit with another doctor in the office who checked his BP, etc.  She felt it was just due to Raynaud's phenomenon and colder weather and to wear thicker socks and keep an eye on it.  We set up an appt for his regular doctor and followed advise.

 His pediatrician also said Raynaud's and b/c his other vitals were normal it was nothing to panic over and just to keep an eye on it.  


We noticed in mainly happened at night and not so much during the day.  We also discovered that if he put his feet up, the redness IMMEDIATELY went away and would return if he put his feet down.  He had a month break from school (starts again next week) and while his pediatrician did not think the redness was related to Adderall, we talked and he agreed we should keep watch while he was completely off Adderall for a long period of time.

It has improved a lot.  Rather than his whole foot getting red, it is now just the tips of his toes, etc.  Same thing.  If he puts his feet up, it goes away immediately.  I'm waiting to hear back from his pediatrician, but he is out of town and likely won't be back for a couple of weeks (he does doctors w/o borders stuff).

Has anyone had any experience with this either as someone who has taken Adderall OR a parent whose child has?  Is this some common, normal thing I shouldn't worry about or is it (as my internet searching found) a potentially permanent serious medical issue?

He starts classes on Monday and I am really reluctant to give him medication that could cause long term harm, but, I know it helps him concentrate and not become enemies with every teacher.

Recently his behavior has been so bad at school and at home ,I feel so out of control and frustrated. He constantly does things that he knows are not OK and apologizes while doing it or directly after -before I even get to reprimand him for it he is going ..sorry sorry sorry. For example ripping up a piece of paper into 1 million tiny pieces and throwing up all over the floor but the second I walked into the room he‚Äôs like SORRY MOMMY I KNOW I KNOW‚Ä¶so I know that he knows the difference.

A little more detail- 
I take 54mg Concerta ER and 10mg Lexapro for anxiety. The concerta has been a constant since I was in middle school, and Lexapro was prescribed to me last year (and has been amazing for managing my overall anxiety and moderate depression). 
I take vitamins every day, B12 and D3 I believe. Doc did a blood test on me a year ago and said taking them would fix the fatigue, but sadly they haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has found some good energy-boosters or OTC supplements to help with this. 
I get great sleep at night, usually 6-8 hours a day and not restless in my sleep. Usually around 2-3pm, I get the overwhelming urge to just fall asleep at my desk and can‚Äôt get past it until I take a 20 minute nap on my lunch break.

145be0l,Take adderall daily?,"Hi everyone. I browse this community often and have found it very useful. This is my first time posting.
I‚Äôm wondering for those on adderall - or I guess any ADHD medication - do you take it daily? My body doesn‚Äôt handle it very well if I even take it two days in a row. So, I have to take breaks. The issue with this is that I rely on my medication to be even remotely productive. I‚Äôm on the tail end of my PhD program and I‚Äôm on crunch time to finish my dissertation. I have extremely productive days on adderall‚Ä¶not productive when I don‚Äôt take it. Have you all found ways to cope with taking it multiple days in a row? Is there a way to make it less hard on my body?

I normally drink coffee on days that I don‚Äôt take adderall. However, caffeine doesn‚Äôt make me productive at all. It just makes my day slightly more tolerable/doable. 

To clarify: it‚Äôs hard on my body in that it causes lots of GI issues. I get very bad stomach cramps and even nausea if I take it too often. (I do eat beforehand and drink a tonnnnn of water throughout the day).",3

I feel like this is the opposite of what should be happening.

I‚Äôve got so many tasks it just feels insurmountable. I‚Äôm a single mom with a creepy toxic ex and my kids keep getting sick or in trouble.

So, I told my parents about it, hahahah... that was a mistake, they just laughed. Told me ADHD is that one uncontrollable child who always plays video games and can't concentrate.

Felt like a gut punch. I do love my parents and respect them, but at the same time it hurt. I'd bring it up a few times but they'd always brush it off.

Im scared I'm scared I'm scared. 

How will my future turn out, I've seen many posts of ppl succeeding, and they were so inspiring to read, but what can I do...

Im pretty good with school, good grades and stuff, but it's the patterns I saw during the school year, hyper fixating on projects that only interested me, had PLENTY enough time to finish assignments and projects but still ending up doing all nighters, AND to top it all off, an unhealthy relationship with caffeine (I can't help myself ok, plus my dad is also a coffee addict, we have beans lying everywhere.)

Even outside of school, summer break started like 4 weeks ago...holy shit 4 weeks is a lot, THATS A LOT, and I have done nothing of the significance... 

I told myself I was gonna start drawing more, learn how to edit videos and Photoshop, do photography (but my camera broke recently rip) even make a new Instagram acc so I can post the cool stuff that I will make

But that's all it is... ""Will make"" some started, but I don't think I have the capacity to keep doing them consistently...

1459nao,I don't know what to do anymore,"Okay so I am in college. I don't live in the US if that's important info even. Basically, I just found out my ADHD symptoms are a huge problem for some poeple in my workgroup. Like, I thought that maybe they had their moments when they were annoyed by me but it passed, but apparently I am viewed much more negatively than I thought???  


I know this is my fault I just don't know how to fix it. I am often late, unfortunately. I try to arrive on time, but it doesn't always work. It's time blindness, I get distracted or plan things wrong and 20 minutes have passed and I don't even know when.   


I just had a conversation with a person from my group who told me what might be causing people to be angry with me. She told me it's the lateness and the fact that I often zone out. Like I have my head in the clouds. I take meds but apparently they don't always help with things (they did manage to help me with learning at least a little bit).  I was once accused of intentionally leaving the classroom when the people from my group stayed and told me to apologize. I didn't do it on purpose, I just haven't noticed them! I apologized of course but it left me very scared of what they thought about me.   


Another time I forgot a message that I sent to a girl from my  group about a report. She sent me a message that I think expressed her irritation with me. I immidiately sorted it out and told her which report I was going to write. I sent her a lenghty message apologizing and told her that I don't always know what to do/remember and that she needs to only write to me and I will do what is needed.   


But the problem isn't that. I am willing to do everything that is needed when I'm asked. The problem with me is that I don't figure out some things. Like the fact that someone might be angry with me over something, like not inquiring about a report. 

I sent all the information that I had to send on the group chat and I waited for someone to engage. I waited and waited but they didn't, I even approached them irl a few times asking if everyting  was okay/if they knew when was the assignment due. 

I was supposed to figure out that I had to send more messages asking about the assignment to show my initiative or something. Instead I waited for other people to write something about the assignment. And this is why they might be mad at me. I don't understand this at all.  


I also told this person about the fact that I have a lot of trouble changing some things about myself, like the lateness and the zoning out. I take meds daily and I used to go to therapy every two weeks (I'm between therapistis right now and I also financially struggle). I told her that this is due to the fact that I have ADHD. She told me that I can't say everything happens due to my ADHD.   


I am at a loss. I don't know what to do. The conversation I had with her made me cry a lot, though of course I hadn't told her that. I am looking for support and some strategies to cope with this. Sorry if this is hard to read, I'm still kind of having an emotional breakdown. XD",6

One task that I did that really helped was to go to General  > Keyboard > Text Replacement

I have the following replacements set up with short codes to help me when navigating on my phone or online:

‚Äú@@‚Äú = name.name@email.com
‚Äú# #‚Äù (no space) = phone number
*** * (no space) = birth date 
// / (no space) = address
int (name initials) = full name

CC Information 
As for credit card information, you can have one or more listed under Settings > (scroll) > Wallet & Apple Pay > enter new credit card information or select what is already been placed into the ‚ÄúWallet‚Äù app. 

Password Maintenance 
There are a variety of ways to save passwords to either your phone or to your preferred password manager program.

Settings > (scroll) > Passwords

I generally use LastPass, which I‚Äôve been using for about 10 years. When you are on a site that requires a password, LastPass will show up as an option (on iPhone). But if it‚Äôs something simple or a site, I won‚Äôt go to that often, I might save it to iCloud Passwords / Keychains.

14594jf,Chronic boredom/hobby burnout,"This is something I‚Äôve struggled with for 4.5 years now. I quit drinking and smoking pot and was diagnosed about 6 months after that (in my late 20s). Ever since then, I have wrestled with being bored out of my mind more often than not. I have picked up some hobbies here and there, but ultimately lost interest in all of them at some point. 


The biggest one was crochet, which I started in November 2022, and became absolutely obsessed with. It was all-consuming. I was regularly losing sleep because I was so into it. I WFH and spent much of my time crocheting when I was meant to be working. I cancelled plans with friends to crochet. I skipped meals. (You get the idea.) Then in March, I just‚Ä¶ lost my spark. I tried to pick it back up a few times but never got very far. I was completely burnt out and now haven‚Äôt touched any of my yarn or works in progress for months. I have no interest in them whatsoever. 


Another example is video games. My fianc√© is a big gamer and suggested several games for me after buying a Switch a few years ago. I got similarly obsessed with some of them (all at different times, not consecutively) and would go through the same hyper-fixation/burnout cycle every time. 


I‚Äôm currently back to where I was before picking up crochet last year: bored as fuck all the time. It is crushing. My biggest pastimes are browsing reddit and watching tv. I have burned through just about every show/movie I‚Äôm interested in on my streaming platforms. I spend more time looking for something new to watch than actually watching anything. I continue to WFH and, for 2/3 of my workweek, I‚Äôm either procrastinating or have finished all my work and am just sitting here‚Ä¶ browsing reddit, bored. 


If you‚Äôre wondering, I do actually go outside! I take walks a couple times a week. I also write in a journal most days. My fianc√© is a great guy and we have a happy relationship. We have 2 cats that I dote on and love with all my heart. I have friends and a small social life (I‚Äôm super introverted so I really don‚Äôt want more than 1 social commitment a week anyway, and some weeks I don‚Äôt want any). I‚Äôm just bored. I hate feeling this way. I feel like it‚Äôs never going to go end. 


FWIW, my meds are Atomoxetine 100mg; BuSpar 45mg; Wellbutrin 150mg; propranolol 60mg; Adderall (generic) 15mg prn/up to twice daily; and Ativan 0.5mg prn. I continue to struggle with loss of focus/concentration and motivation even with the meds. I‚Äôve been on them all for a long time aside from the Ativan which I just started last month. I‚Äôve been in therapy for years and have touched on the boredom/hobby thing many times. 


I‚Äôm really just here to vent, y‚Äôall. Sometimes I really feel like there‚Äôs no point to living if this is it. I work, do chores, watch tv, and sleep (and I mean this in an existential way, not a suicidal one). I look forward to going to bed because it is an escape from the boredom. 


Again, just here to vent. Needed to get this out into the void. Feel free to commiserate.",1

I saw someone post about their bad memory driving them crazy and I truly felt that.  
I can do everything right and still won't be able to hold a coherant thought or plan for more than 30 seconds at a time. Hobby projects are so damn hard sometimes because I constantly forget what I was trying to build or the steps I was going to take to get their.

Beaten, broken, shot, exhausted but still they keep going forward. Tired, angry, sad, broken, or empty it doesn't matter. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other. That's all, just one step at a time. Hell, that's the only thing that's kept me alive at times.

1458mhg,How to deal with a change in work schedule?,"My work schedule is temporarily changing after this weekend so that I'm starting half an hour earlier and leaving an hour earlier, and I'm fully panicking. I know it's not a massive change, but it is just enough to throw my sacred morning routine into disarray. When I got the email yesterday I almost had a panic attack. I had to go take a walk to calm myself down. This news disrupted my sleep last night, as I spent literally the whole night obsessing about my new morning routine.

I spent several hours last night plugging as much of my morning routine into my scheduling apps (Apple calendar, Outlook calendar for work, Due, reminders, etc). I've even added how long I'm allowing myself to stay in bed before I have to get out, how long I'm giving myself to use the bathroom, how long I'm giving myself to shower, how long I'm giving myself to brush my teeth, how long I'm giving myself to drive and find parking (hopefully I gave myself enough time). The only mystery is what time I'll have to take my meds now. It's been trial-and-error and I finally found the time that works for me the best where I crash during the last half hour of my day. I would add an afternoon dose, but I'm very concerned about keeping controlled substances on my person or at my desk at work, even with a diagnosis and with HR aware of my diagnosis. I'm worried my coworkers might try and steal my meds if I keep it at my desk, and I think law here is that you have to keep controlled meds in their original packaging, which as a guy who doesn't carry a purse, and has a giant wallet, key ring, cell phone, airpods, etc. I can't fit a Walgreens RX bottle in my pocket.

Idk am I needlessly freaking out? Am I just going to adjust? Or am I going to have to put 110% of my energy and focus into every little part of my morning routine? How much do I need to program into my apps to make sure I'm here at something that resembles my new start time? Things like ""take butter out of fridge,"" ""put butter on toast,"" ""put toast in plate,"" ""eat toast,"" - 5 minutes? I genuinely need tips on how to adjust to my new schedule so that it's second nature, and I don't accidentally show up 30 minutes late. I also need tips on how to stop panicking over this because I'm already exhausted and I just started my day like 20 minutes ago.",1
1458bef,How do you deal with long flights?,"As per title, how do you all manage to sit still in one place for many hours?

I'm flying to Germany next month, and I'm having major anxiety already about sitting still in my cramped seat for 11h. I'm not *afraid* of flying at all, it's literally just this feeling of being ""immobilized"" and the inability to move around and stretch my legs the way I want. I normally sit on my office chair cross legged or in some other weird pose, but as a 6'2"", 300lbs guy that's just not an option in an air plane. I know I can get up and walk up and down the aisle of course, but if you have a large frame that's just no fun either (sideways shuffle to the bathroom while ducking your head).

Obviously I can't sleep on airplanes no matter how tired I am. I once made the big mistake of taking Niquil before a flight thinking that'll do it, but that just made me tired and cranky in addition to fidgety, so yay...

Anyway, how do you all deal with this? I'm reading books, watching movies, audiobooks, etc; but that only distracts me so long. A friend suggested to ask my doctor for Xanax, but I'm afraid that a) it won't work and it'll just make me cranky again and b) that the doctor won't prescribe it anyway cause I already take ADHD meds.

14577rl,About being emotionally unstable,"Trigger warning: SA and violence

As long as I remember, any mention of SA made me feel very unstable. The worse the story, the closer I feel to genuine madness. I don't know how to describe it, I just feel like my sanity is draining away and I grab at it while it slips through my fingers like sand.

When people defend SA or its perpetrators in front of me, I see red and I have to exercise an insane amount of self-control to keep myself from getting physically violent. I live in a country where feminism is used as a curse word, women's issues are constantly dismissed, and all kinds of shit happens. It means a ton of triggering shit hits the news every day. 

I can't avoid the news entirely because it might contain vital information (being oblivious to news cost a lot of people their lives just last year during riots). But the news are not what makes me feel like I will start hitting my head on the wall. It's the historical stuff.

Former soviet union has had horrors untold being done to both men and women. Sometimes I just come across some historical records that makes me wish for apocalypse to wipe us all out. I cannot even tldr what I read.

I'm not sure if it made it worse, but I've been harassed and assaulted multiple times in my short life, and I still have trust issues around men too. I don't know if I've dealt with it properly, tbh. Should I talk about it with my therapist? 

Does anyone else struggle with something similar? I feel so alone with this feeling of... Like I'm about to really lose it üò≠ Like one more little push and I will break my mind beyond repair( I'm so scared and I just want it to stop!

However, I believe Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) includes a lysine molecule which serves multiple benefits - lysine aids the metabolism if Vyvanse and lysine is a precursor to dopamine.

Another thing my therapist saod was i need to find something that motives me, without getting burnout. I have never been able to find something without getting burnout, the longest I lasted was around 6 months. I noticed i started getting anxiety and having panic attacks at work and being more depressed then usual thats when I drew the final straw.I made a appoint to be seen and then I finally recieved my diagnosis. He asked me a couple questions, did a blood draw for dopamine. Saw my education records both high school and college, and came to the conclusion that i have inattentive ADD.

>Think about that. ADHD people who heal their trauma and their relationship to panic and anxiety and shame *suddenly find themselves unable to do their jobs or focus on their responsibilities*. Why?

>Because fear was all that was motivating them. They have to relearn how to want.

This is 100% me. I have felt the ‚Äúrelearning how to want‚Äù so hard. (Advice/solidarity on that welcomeüíû)

‚ÄúOnly lack of punishment.‚Äù üéØüíî

ETA: I of course would love if this thread included a magic bullet solution to the problem it so acutely identifies, but it does not, alas‚Ä¶FWIW, maybe I‚Äôm delusional but I personally do feel hopeful that there is a way to live and thrive on the other side of fear motivation. I don‚Äôt want to go back to living fueled by pure anxiety, and I‚Äôm hopeful I can carve a better wayü§û
I don‚Äôt have any tricks myself, but in case it helps anyone else, two things that do help me some re tasks are 
1) instead of saying to myself ‚ÄúI have to do x‚Äù, saying ‚ÄúI want to do x‚Äù (and ‚ÄúI want to do x because‚Ä¶‚Äù). This only works if on some level I do want to do it lol. 
2)  focusing on how finishing a task will make me feel, and generally trying to really notice and integrate what I enjoy and makes me feel good. Eg I finally washed all the dishes in my sink the other day (wow I know!) and it really does feel nice and kinda more peaceful to walk in my kitchen and see the bottom of my sink. Maybe silly I know but it works for me for some things :)
ETA2: of course I keep thinking of things to add ü§£
3) novelty - I guess this is the curiosity thing. On the big scale, I think I‚Äôve realized I just have to accept I need to change jobs every few years, like, in perpetuity? üò¨Small scale, trying new ways to do things sometimes helps, even dumb little ways to make things ‚Äúharder‚Äù, like balancing on one foot while I brush my teeth.",2516
