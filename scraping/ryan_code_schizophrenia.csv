There have been a growing number of Discord and various social software invites posted of late.

We'd like to cut down on the noise, and facilitate making it easy for people to both advertise and discover the plethora of social media groups and Discord servers you all run.

There are some proposed ground rules for this new initiative:

* Invites must only be posted to the monthly Megathread. A new thread will be posted on the 1st of the month at 6pm London time.
* Please post a direct invite link for your server / group, and avoid practices such as asking people to message you in private.
* Because private groups do sometimes result in drama, or unhealthy environments, you must be open to an r/schizophrenia moderator freely wandering in to check it out, if we receive any complaints or safety concerns are raised.

,schizophrenia,"Someone posted here over the past week that they took an online schizophrenia test that showed a high probability of schizophrenia. They were already diagnosed with schizophrenia and found it amusing.

I have been diagnosed as a schizophrenic for almost twenty years. Tried therapy, meds, etc. I do experience some audio hallucinations, but they didn't start until some traumatic experiences that took place several years AFTER being diagnosed. I do not find them particularly distressing. I was initially diagnosed over some beliefs about things that were happening in my life that even I was able to admit were improbable, but they were clearly not impossible.

I just took multiple, free online tests for assessing schizophrenia. All but one indicated low and/or NO probability of schizophrenia. The one that indicated a problem, only acknowledged that I have had significant distress over some things. It didn't give a strong indication of psychosis itself.

I mean, I never made shit up while talking with therapists. I even had a disability review over the past few years where they considered me disabled.

They were already diagnosed with schizophrenia and found it amusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been diagnosed as a schizophrenic for almost twenty years. Tried therapy, meds, etc. I do experience some audio hallucinations, but they didn&amp;#39;t start until some traumatic experiences that took place several years AFTER being diagnosed. I do not find them particularly distressing. I was initially diagnosed over some beliefs about things that were happening in my life that even I was able to admit were improbable, but they were clearly not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just took multiple, free online tests for assessing schizophrenia. All but one indicated low and/or NO probability of schizophrenia. The one that indicated a problem, only acknowledged that I have had significant distress over some things. It didn&amp;#39;t give a strong indication of psychosis itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I never made shit up while talking with therapists. I even had a disability review over the past few years where they considered me disabled. At the review, I was uncharacteristically blunt and open and honestly expected NOT to be considered disabled any longer. But I got my disability payments renewed.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hi guys,

I hope you are doing well and not letting this disease get the best of you (so many amazing, kind, smart, and brave people on here, you inspire me!). Lately, I am starting to realize that the avolition and anhedonia I feel is not from my medication (I take about 2 mg of olanzapine daily) but is rather the negative symptoms I experience after my last Really bad psychosis. I think it gave me some sort of brain damage because it was so wild and crazy what i went through. The reason for my conclusion comes from the fact that these couple of days I took less olanzapine and I didn't feel any better, in fact, i even felt more depressed. I was wondering if my brain will ever feel better. I used to be a happy individual with so many interests. Most importantly I was very active and i found so much joy in moving, now moving is simply painful. Do our brains have the capacity to heal and get better? 

Also, I keep thinking what happened to me last year, how could my psychosis been so so bad but now I am Ok on such a small amount of medication? Before my psychosis I smoked an obscene amount of pot, like chain smoking day and night, sometimes the pot would not even be from a good source or from god knows where.. Is it possible that what happened to me was drug-induced psychosis and maybe even if i have schizophrenia if i stay away from drugs and stress maybe it could be managed on relatively small doses of APs? 

I hope all of you are doing well. Also, wanted to update that i finally tried Vraylar but it made me bed bound, i was not willing to sit with the side effects for a while to see if maybe the drug could work for me, I decided to stop taking it and talk to my doctor see what could be done about it. Thank you so much everybody for all your help and support!!! I don't know what I would do without this forum.

There have been a growing number of Discord and various social software invites posted of late.

We'd like to cut down on the noise, and facilitate making it easy for people to both advertise and discover the plethora of social media groups and Discord servers you all run.

There are some proposed ground rules for this new initiative:

* Invites must only be posted to the monthly Megathread. A new thread will be posted on the 1st of the month at 6pm London time.
* Please post a direct invite link for your server / group, and avoid practices such as asking people to message you in private.
* Because private groups do sometimes result in drama, or unhealthy environments, you must be open to an r/schizophrenia moderator freely wandering in to check it out, if we receive any complaints or safety concerns are raised.

The voices I hear consistently attack me with a terrible lie. What they say isn't true, but it's impossible for me to prove it.

I'm not asking anyone to tell us what that lie is. If you're situation is like mine, you'll not want to voice it anyway.

It's just, do they constantly accuse you of something that simply isn't true?

They choke the shit out of me to start and usually leads to a few cuts, pulling out hairs, slapping my face. But when it’s bad bad, I start feeling like someone is behind me.

I get a good right elbow in and it’s on. Tease with my left and send a fuckin banger with the right. Every time down goes Charlie.

,schizophrenia,"Hi guys,

I hope you are doing well and not letting this disease get the best of you (so many amazing, kind, smart, and brave people on here, you inspire me!). Lately, I am starting to realize that the avolition and anhedonia I feel is not from my medication (I take about 2 mg of olanzapine daily) but is rather the negative symptoms I experience after my last Really bad psychosis. I think it gave me some sort of brain damage because it was so wild and crazy what i went through. The reason for my conclusion comes from the fact that these couple of days I took less olanzapine and I didn't feel any better, in fact, i even felt more depressed. I was wondering if my brain will ever feel better. I used to be a happy individual with so many interests. Most importantly I was very active and i found so much joy in moving, now moving is simply painful. Do our brains have the capacity to heal and get better? 

Also, I keep thinking what happened to me last year, how could my psychosis been so so bad but now I am Ok on such a small amount of medication? Before my psychosis I smoked an obscene amount of pot, like chain smoking day and night, sometimes the pot would not even be from a good source or from god knows where.. Is it possible that what happened to me was drug-induced psychosis and maybe even if i have schizophrenia if i stay away from drugs and stress maybe it could be managed on relatively small doses of APs? 

I hope all of you are doing well. Also, wanted to update that i finally tried Vraylar but it made me bed bound, i was not willing to sit with the side effects for a while to see if maybe the drug could work for me, I decided to stop taking it and talk to my doctor see what could be done about it.

,schizophrenia,"Although easier said than done, these tips can enhance dopamine levels and keep energy levels up until you are able to adjust to your medications dopamine reducing effects. Most medication cause low energy levels, fatigue, inability to focus and stay alert. These key points if put into motion can counter these side effects.

If you have any tips or routines that help you keep your energy/motivation levels up, please do share them in this thread.  


**Suggested Routine to naturally boost dopamine levels**

**Morning:**

* 	Start the day with 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such 	as a brisk walk or a workout routine. This can help increase 	dopamine levels and promote overall well-being.
* Consume a 	balanced breakfast that includes foods rich in tyrosine, such as 	eggs, lean meats, or legumes. Include fruits or vegetables for added 	antioxidants.  
 

**Daytime:**

* 	Throughout the day, practice stress management techniques whenever 	needed. Take short breaks to engage in deep breathing exercises, 	meditation, or mindfulness to reduce stress levels and support 	dopamine balance.
* Stay 	hydrated and consider replacing caffeinated beverages with herbal 	tea or water.  
 

**Afternoon:**

* Take a 	break for creative activities or hobbies that bring you joy. This 	can include listening to music, painting, writing, or engaging in 	any other creative pursuits that stimulate dopamine release.

&amp;#x200B;

**Evening:**

* Allocate 	time for socializing with friends or loved ones. Plan activities 	like going for a walk together, having a meal, or engaging in 	meaningful conversations that promote positive social interactions 	and support dopamine levels.  
 

**Night:**

* Before 	bedtime, create a calm and conducive environment for quality sleep. 	Establish a regular sleep schedule and aim for 7-9 hours of 	uninterrupted sleep. Avoid the use of caffeine or ephedrine in the 	evening, as they may interfere with sleep quality and dopamine 	regulation.  
 

**Dopamine Enhancing Dietary Overview**

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Proteins:** 	Foods rich in proteins provide the necessary building blocks for 	dopamine synthesis. Include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, 	legumes, and dairy products in your diet.  
 
2. **Tyrosine-rich foods:** Tyrosine is an amino acid involved in dopamine synthesis. 	Foods such as almonds, avocados, bananas, eggs, chicken, and turkey 	are good sources of tyrosine.  
 
3. **Leafy greens:** Dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, and collard greens 	contain high levels of folate. Folate is important for 	neurotransmitter synthesis, including dopamine.  
 
4. **Fruits and vegetables:** Berries, particularly blueberries, are rich in 	antioxidants and may have neuroprotective effects, promoting brain 	health. Other fruits and vegetables, such as oranges, tomatoes, and 	bell peppers, provide essential vitamins and minerals that support 	dopamine function.  
 
5. **Nuts and seeds:** Almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds are rich 	in nutrients like magnesium, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids, which 	are beneficial for brain health and neurotransmitter function.  
 
6. **Dark chocolate:** Dark chocolate contains compounds like flavonoids and 	phenylethylamine (PEA), which may help enhance mood and support 	dopamine release. Choose dark chocolate with a high cocoa content 	(70% or higher) and consume in moderation.  
 
7. **Green tea:** Green tea contains an amino acid called L-theanine, which 	has been shown to have a positive impact on dopamine levels and 	brain function. It can promote relaxation while enhancing alertness.  
 
8. **Turmeric:** 	Turmeric contains curcumin, a compound known for its 	anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It may help protect 	dopamine-producing neurons and support overall brain health.  
 
9. **Probiotic-rich foods:** Emerging research suggests a link between gut health and 	dopamine production. Including fermented foods like yogurt, 	sauerkraut, kimchi, and kefir in your diet can support a healthy gut 	microbiome, which may indirectly influence dopamine levels.  
 
10. **Water:** 	Staying hydrated is essential for optimal brain function, including 	neurotransmitter synthesis and release. Make sure to drink an 	adequate amount of water throughout the day.  
 

**Other Considerations: Enhance and Maintain dopamine levels**

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Regular exercise:** 	Engaging in aerobic exercises like running, swimming, or cycling can 	stimulate dopamine release and promote overall brain health. Aim for 	at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the 	week.  
 
2. **Get enough sleep:** Quality sleep is essential for proper 	neurotransmitter function, including dopamine regulation. Aim for 	7-9 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night to support optimal brain 	health.  
 
3. **Manage stress:** Chronic stress can negatively impact dopamine levels. 	Explore stress-reducing techniques such as meditation, deep 	breathing exercises, yoga, or engaging in hobbies and activities you 	enjoy.  
 
4. **Listen to music:** Listening to music you love can induce pleasure and 	increase dopamine release. Choose music that uplifts your mood and 	makes you feel good.  
 
5. **Set and 	achieve goals:** Accomplishing goals, both big and small, can 	activate the brain's reward pathways and boost dopamine levels. 	Break larger goals into smaller, achievable tasks to experience a 	sense of accomplishment along the way.  
 
6. **Practice	mindfulness:** Mindfulness exercises, such as meditation or 	mindful breathing, can help improve dopamine receptor sensitivity 	and enhance overall well-being.  
 
7. **Spend time in nature:** Being in nature has been shown to have a 	positive impact on mood and overall brain health. Take walks in 	green spaces, go hiking, or simply spend time outdoors to 	potentially increase dopamine levels.  
 
8. **Socialize and connect:** Engaging in meaningful social interactions, 	spending time with loved ones, and nurturing relationships can 	stimulate dopamine release and promote feelings of happiness and 	well-being.  
 
9. **Seek  pleasurable experiences:** Engage in activities that bring you joy 	and pleasure, whether it's playing a musical instrument, dancing, 	painting, or engaging in hobbies you are passionate about. Enjoying 	pleasurable experiences can enhance dopamine release.  
 
10. **Limit excessive dopamine-depleting behaviors:** Certain behaviors like 	excessive consumption of alcohol, drug use, and excessive gambling 	can deplete dopamine levels over time. Moderation and balance are 	key.",t2_mrnnl,False,,0,False,Dopamine Enhancing routine/diet to combat energy draining effects of anti-psychotic medication,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,False,t3_1494mg2,False,light,0.89,,public,12,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice / Encouragement,False,12,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1686739474.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although easier said than done, these tips can enhance dopamine levels and keep energy levels up until you are able to adjust to your medications dopamine reducing effects. Most medication cause low energy levels, fatigue, inability to focus and stay alert. These key points if put into motion can counter these side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any tips or routines that help you keep your energy/motivation levels up, please do share them in this thread.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggested Routine to naturally boost dopamine levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Start the day with 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such  as a brisk walk or a workout routine. This can help increase    dopamine levels and promote overall well-being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consume a     balanced breakfast that includes foods rich in tyrosine, such as    eggs, lean meats, or legumes. Include fruits or vegetables for added    antioxidants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daytime:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Throughout the day, practice stress management techniques whenever  needed. Take short breaks to engage in deep breathing exercises,    meditation, or mindfulness to reduce stress levels and support  dopamine balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay  hydrated and consider replacing caffeinated beverages with herbal   tea or water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afternoon:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a    break for creative activities or hobbies that bring you joy. This   can include listening to music, painting, writing, or engaging in   any other creative pursuits that stimulate dopamine release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evening:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocate  time for socializing with friends or loved ones. Plan activities    like going for a walk together, having a meal, or engaging in   meaningful conversations that promote positive social interactions  and support dopamine levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before    bedtime, create a calm and conducive environment for quality sleep.     Establish a regular sleep schedule and aim for 7-9 hours of     uninterrupted sleep. Avoid the use of caffeine or ephedrine in the  evening, as they may interfere with sleep quality and dopamine  regulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine Enhancing Dietary Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proteins:&lt;/strong&gt;    Foods rich in proteins provide the necessary building blocks for    dopamine synthesis. Include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, tofu,  legumes, and dairy products in your diet.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tyrosine-rich foods:&lt;/strong&gt; Tyrosine is an amino acid involved in dopamine synthesis.   Foods such as almonds, avocados, bananas, eggs, chicken, and turkey     are good sources of tyrosine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leafy greens:&lt;/strong&gt; Dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, and collard greens   contain high levels of folate. Folate is important for  neurotransmitter synthesis, including dopamine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruits and vegetables:&lt;/strong&gt; Berries, particularly blueberries, are rich in    antioxidants and may have neuroprotective effects, promoting brain  health. Other fruits and vegetables, such as oranges, tomatoes, and     bell peppers, provide essential vitamins and minerals that support  dopamine function.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuts and seeds:&lt;/strong&gt; Almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds are rich     in nutrients like magnesium, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids, which   are beneficial for brain health and neurotransmitter function.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark chocolate:&lt;/strong&gt; Dark chocolate contains compounds like flavonoids and    phenylethylamine (PEA), which may help enhance mood and support     dopamine release. Choose dark chocolate with a high cocoa content   (70% or higher) and consume in moderation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green tea:&lt;/strong&gt; Green tea contains an amino acid called L-theanine, which     has been shown to have a positive impact on dopamine levels and     brain function. It can promote relaxation while enhancing alertness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turmeric:&lt;/strong&gt;    Turmeric contains curcumin, a compound known for its    anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It may help protect   dopamine-producing neurons and support overall brain health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probiotic-rich foods:&lt;/strong&gt; Emerging research suggests a link between gut health and   dopamine production. Including fermented foods like yogurt,     sauerkraut, kimchi, and kefir in your diet can support a healthy gut    microbiome, which may indirectly influence dopamine levels.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water:&lt;/strong&gt;  Staying hydrated is essential for optimal brain function, including     neurotransmitter synthesis and release. Make sure to drink an   adequate amount of water throughout the day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Considerations: Enhance and Maintain dopamine levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular exercise:&lt;/strong&gt;    Engaging in aerobic exercises like running, swimming, or cycling can    stimulate dopamine release and promote overall brain health. Aim for    at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the     week.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get enough sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Quality sleep is essential for proper  neurotransmitter function, including dopamine regulation. Aim for   7-9 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night to support optimal brain    health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress can negatively impact dopamine levels.     Explore stress-reducing techniques such as meditation, deep     breathing exercises, yoga, or engaging in hobbies and activities you    enjoy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to music:&lt;/strong&gt; Listening to music you love can induce pleasure and     increase dopamine release. Choose music that uplifts your mood and  makes you feel good.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set and    achieve goals:&lt;/strong&gt; Accomplishing goals, both big and small, can   activate the brain&amp;#39;s reward pathways and boost dopamine levels.     Break larger goals into smaller, achievable tasks to experience a   sense of accomplishment along the way.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice   mindfulness:&lt;/strong&gt; Mindfulness exercises, such as meditation or     mindful breathing, can help improve dopamine receptor sensitivity   and enhance overall well-being.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spend time in nature:&lt;/strong&gt; Being in nature has been shown to have a   positive impact on mood and overall brain health. Take walks in     green spaces, go hiking, or simply spend time outdoors to   potentially increase dopamine levels.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socialize and connect:&lt;/strong&gt; Engaging in meaningful social interactions,   spending time with loved ones, and nurturing relationships can  stimulate dopamine release and promote feelings of happiness and    well-being.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek  pleasurable experiences:&lt;/strong&gt; Engage in activities that bring you joy   and pleasure, whether it&amp;#39;s playing a musical instrument, dancing,   painting, or engaging in hobbies you are passionate about.

,schizophrenia,"My dad couldn’t handle more than 10 minutes shopping in a public place. He use to say that every person he passed by was either judging him or conveying some kind of “meaning” with just a passing glance.

There have been a growing number of Discord and various social software invites posted of late.

We'd like to cut down on the noise, and facilitate making it easy for people to both advertise and discover the plethora of social media groups and Discord servers you all run.

There are some proposed ground rules for this new initiative:

* Invites must only be posted to the monthly Megathread. A new thread will be posted on the 1st of the month at 6pm London time.
* Please post a direct invite link for your server / group, and avoid practices such as asking people to message you in private.
* Because private groups do sometimes result in drama, or unhealthy environments, you must be open to an r/schizophrenia moderator freely wandering in to check it out, if we receive any complaints or safety concerns are raised.

,schizophrenia,"Someone posted here over the past week that they took an online schizophrenia test that showed a high probability of schizophrenia. They were already diagnosed with schizophrenia and found it amusing.

I have been diagnosed as a schizophrenic for almost twenty years. Tried therapy, meds, etc. I do experience some audio hallucinations, but they didn't start until some traumatic experiences that took place several years AFTER being diagnosed. I do not find them particularly distressing. I was initially diagnosed over some beliefs about things that were happening in my life that even I was able to admit were improbable, but they were clearly not impossible.

I just took multiple, free online tests for assessing schizophrenia. All but one indicated low and/or NO probability of schizophrenia. The one that indicated a problem, only acknowledged that I have had significant distress over some things. It didn't give a strong indication of psychosis itself.

I mean, I never made shit up while talking with therapists. I even had a disability review over the past few years where they considered me disabled.

&lt;p&gt;I have been diagnosed as a schizophrenic for almost twenty years. Tried therapy, meds, etc. I do experience some audio hallucinations, but they didn&amp;#39;t start until some traumatic experiences that took place several years AFTER being diagnosed. I do not find them particularly distressing. I was initially diagnosed over some beliefs about things that were happening in my life that even I was able to admit were improbable, but they were clearly not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just took multiple, free online tests for assessing schizophrenia. All but one indicated low and/or NO probability of schizophrenia. The one that indicated a problem, only acknowledged that I have had significant distress over some things. It didn&amp;#39;t give a strong indication of psychosis itself.&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"Hi guys,

I hope you are doing well and not letting this disease get the best of you (so many amazing, kind, smart, and brave people on here, you inspire me!). Lately, I am starting to realize that the avolition and anhedonia I feel is not from my medication (I take about 2 mg of olanzapine daily) but is rather the negative symptoms I experience after my last Really bad psychosis. I think it gave me some sort of brain damage because it was so wild and crazy what i went through. The reason for my conclusion comes from the fact that these couple of days I took less olanzapine and I didn't feel any better, in fact, i even felt more depressed. I was wondering if my brain will ever feel better. I used to be a happy individual with so many interests. Most importantly I was very active and i found so much joy in moving, now moving is simply painful. Do our brains have the capacity to heal and get better? 

Also, I keep thinking what happened to me last year, how could my psychosis been so so bad but now I am Ok on such a small amount of medication? Before my psychosis I smoked an obscene amount of pot, like chain smoking day and night, sometimes the pot would not even be from a good source or from god knows where.. Is it possible that what happened to me was drug-induced psychosis and maybe even if i have schizophrenia if i stay away from drugs and stress maybe it could be managed on relatively small doses of APs? 

I hope all of you are doing well. Also, wanted to update that i finally tried Vraylar but it made me bed bound, i was not willing to sit with the side effects for a while to see if maybe the drug could work for me, I decided to stop taking it and talk to my doctor see what could be done about it.

,schizophrenia,"Although easier said than done, these tips can enhance dopamine levels and keep energy levels up until you are able to adjust to your medications dopamine reducing effects. Most medication cause low energy levels, fatigue, inability to focus and stay alert. These key points if put into motion can counter these side effects.

If you have any tips or routines that help you keep your energy/motivation levels up, please do share them in this thread.  


**Suggested Routine to naturally boost dopamine levels**

**Morning:**

* 	Start the day with 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such 	as a brisk walk or a workout routine. This can help increase 	dopamine levels and promote overall well-being.
* Consume a 	balanced breakfast that includes foods rich in tyrosine, such as 	eggs, lean meats, or legumes. Include fruits or vegetables for added 	antioxidants.  
 

**Daytime:**

* 	Throughout the day, practice stress management techniques whenever 	needed. Take short breaks to engage in deep breathing exercises, 	meditation, or mindfulness to reduce stress levels and support 	dopamine balance.
* Stay 	hydrated and consider replacing caffeinated beverages with herbal 	tea or water.  
 

**Afternoon:**

* Take a 	break for creative activities or hobbies that bring you joy. This 	can include listening to music, painting, writing, or engaging in 	any other creative pursuits that stimulate dopamine release.

&amp;#x200B;

**Evening:**

* Allocate 	time for socializing with friends or loved ones. Plan activities 	like going for a walk together, having a meal, or engaging in 	meaningful conversations that promote positive social interactions 	and support dopamine levels.  
 

**Night:**

* Before 	bedtime, create a calm and conducive environment for quality sleep. 	Establish a regular sleep schedule and aim for 7-9 hours of 	uninterrupted sleep. Avoid the use of caffeine or ephedrine in the 	evening, as they may interfere with sleep quality and dopamine 	regulation.  
 

**Dopamine Enhancing Dietary Overview**

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Proteins:** 	Foods rich in proteins provide the necessary building blocks for 	dopamine synthesis. Include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, 	legumes, and dairy products in your diet.  
 
2. **Tyrosine-rich foods:** Tyrosine is an amino acid involved in dopamine synthesis. 	Foods such as almonds, avocados, bananas, eggs, chicken, and turkey 	are good sources of tyrosine.  
 
3. **Leafy greens:** Dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, and collard greens 	contain high levels of folate. Folate is important for 	neurotransmitter synthesis, including dopamine.  
 
4. **Fruits and vegetables:** Berries, particularly blueberries, are rich in 	antioxidants and may have neuroprotective effects, promoting brain 	health. Other fruits and vegetables, such as oranges, tomatoes, and 	bell peppers, provide essential vitamins and minerals that support 	dopamine function.  
 
5. **Nuts and seeds:** Almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds are rich 	in nutrients like magnesium, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids, which 	are beneficial for brain health and neurotransmitter function.  
 
6. **Dark chocolate:** Dark chocolate contains compounds like flavonoids and 	phenylethylamine (PEA), which may help enhance mood and support 	dopamine release. Choose dark chocolate with a high cocoa content 	(70% or higher) and consume in moderation.  
 
7. **Green tea:** Green tea contains an amino acid called L-theanine, which 	has been shown to have a positive impact on dopamine levels and 	brain function. It can promote relaxation while enhancing alertness.  
 
8. **Turmeric:** 	Turmeric contains curcumin, a compound known for its 	anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It may help protect 	dopamine-producing neurons and support overall brain health.  
 
9. **Probiotic-rich foods:** Emerging research suggests a link between gut health and 	dopamine production. Including fermented foods like yogurt, 	sauerkraut, kimchi, and kefir in your diet can support a healthy gut 	microbiome, which may indirectly influence dopamine levels.  
 
10. **Water:** 	Staying hydrated is essential for optimal brain function, including 	neurotransmitter synthesis and release. Make sure to drink an 	adequate amount of water throughout the day.  
 

**Other Considerations: Enhance and Maintain dopamine levels**

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Regular exercise:** 	Engaging in aerobic exercises like running, swimming, or cycling can 	stimulate dopamine release and promote overall brain health. Aim for 	at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the 	week.  
 
2. **Get enough sleep:** Quality sleep is essential for proper 	neurotransmitter function, including dopamine regulation. Aim for 	7-9 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night to support optimal brain 	health.  
 
3. **Manage stress:** Chronic stress can negatively impact dopamine levels. 	Explore stress-reducing techniques such as meditation, deep 	breathing exercises, yoga, or engaging in hobbies and activities you 	enjoy.  
 
4. **Listen to music:** Listening to music you love can induce pleasure and 	increase dopamine release. Choose music that uplifts your mood and 	makes you feel good.  
 
5. **Set and 	achieve goals:** Accomplishing goals, both big and small, can 	activate the brain's reward pathways and boost dopamine levels. 	Break larger goals into smaller, achievable tasks to experience a 	sense of accomplishment along the way.  
 
6. **Practice	mindfulness:** Mindfulness exercises, such as meditation or 	mindful breathing, can help improve dopamine receptor sensitivity 	and enhance overall well-being.  
 
7. **Spend time in nature:** Being in nature has been shown to have a 	positive impact on mood and overall brain health. Take walks in 	green spaces, go hiking, or simply spend time outdoors to 	potentially increase dopamine levels.  
 
8. **Socialize and connect:** Engaging in meaningful social interactions, 	spending time with loved ones, and nurturing relationships can 	stimulate dopamine release and promote feelings of happiness and 	well-being.  
 
9. **Seek  pleasurable experiences:** Engage in activities that bring you joy 	and pleasure, whether it's playing a musical instrument, dancing, 	painting, or engaging in hobbies you are passionate about. Enjoying 	pleasurable experiences can enhance dopamine release.  
 
10. **Limit excessive dopamine-depleting behaviors:** Certain behaviors like 	excessive consumption of alcohol, drug use, and excessive gambling 	can deplete dopamine levels over time.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a    break for creative activities or hobbies that bring you joy. This   can include listening to music, painting, writing, or engaging in   any other creative pursuits that stimulate dopamine release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evening:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocate  time for socializing with friends or loved ones. Plan activities    like going for a walk together, having a meal, or engaging in   meaningful conversations that promote positive social interactions  and support dopamine levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before    bedtime, create a calm and conducive environment for quality sleep.     Establish a regular sleep schedule and aim for 7-9 hours of     uninterrupted sleep. Avoid the use of caffeine or ephedrine in the  evening, as they may interfere with sleep quality and dopamine  regulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine Enhancing Dietary Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proteins:&lt;/strong&gt;    Foods rich in proteins provide the necessary building blocks for    dopamine synthesis. Include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, tofu,  legumes, and dairy products in your diet.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tyrosine-rich foods:&lt;/strong&gt; Tyrosine is an amino acid involved in dopamine synthesis.   Foods such as almonds, avocados, bananas, eggs, chicken, and turkey     are good sources of tyrosine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leafy greens:&lt;/strong&gt; Dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, and collard greens   contain high levels of folate. Folate is important for  neurotransmitter synthesis, including dopamine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruits and vegetables:&lt;/strong&gt; Berries, particularly blueberries, are rich in    antioxidants and may have neuroprotective effects, promoting brain  health. Other fruits and vegetables, such as oranges, tomatoes, and     bell peppers, provide essential vitamins and minerals that support  dopamine function.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuts and seeds:&lt;/strong&gt; Almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds are rich     in nutrients like magnesium, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids, which   are beneficial for brain health and neurotransmitter function.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark chocolate:&lt;/strong&gt; Dark chocolate contains compounds like flavonoids and    phenylethylamine (PEA), which may help enhance mood and support     dopamine release. Choose dark chocolate with a high cocoa content   (70% or higher) and consume in moderation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green tea:&lt;/strong&gt; Green tea contains an amino acid called L-theanine, which     has been shown to have a positive impact on dopamine levels and     brain function. It can promote relaxation while enhancing alertness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turmeric:&lt;/strong&gt;    Turmeric contains curcumin, a compound known for its    anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It may help protect   dopamine-producing neurons and support overall brain health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probiotic-rich foods:&lt;/strong&gt; Emerging research suggests a link between gut health and   dopamine production. Including fermented foods like yogurt,     sauerkraut, kimchi, and kefir in your diet can support a healthy gut    microbiome, which may indirectly influence dopamine levels.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water:&lt;/strong&gt;  Staying hydrated is essential for optimal brain function, including     neurotransmitter synthesis and release. Make sure to drink an   adequate amount of water throughout the day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Considerations: Enhance and Maintain dopamine levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular exercise:&lt;/strong&gt;    Engaging in aerobic exercises like running, swimming, or cycling can    stimulate dopamine release and promote overall brain health. Aim for    at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the     week.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get enough sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Quality sleep is essential for proper  neurotransmitter function, including dopamine regulation. Aim for   7-9 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night to support optimal brain    health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress can negatively impact dopamine levels.     Explore stress-reducing techniques such as meditation, deep     breathing exercises, yoga, or engaging in hobbies and activities you    enjoy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to music:&lt;/strong&gt; Listening to music you love can induce pleasure and     increase dopamine release. Choose music that uplifts your mood and  makes you feel good.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set and    achieve goals:&lt;/strong&gt; Accomplishing goals, both big and small, can   activate the brain&amp;#39;s reward pathways and boost dopamine levels.     Break larger goals into smaller, achievable tasks to experience a   sense of accomplishment along the way.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice   mindfulness:&lt;/strong&gt; Mindfulness exercises, such as meditation or     mindful breathing, can help improve dopamine receptor sensitivity   and enhance overall well-being.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spend time in nature:&lt;/strong&gt; Being in nature has been shown to have a   positive impact on mood and overall brain health. Take walks in     green spaces, go hiking, or simply spend time outdoors to   potentially increase dopamine levels.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socialize and connect:&lt;/strong&gt; Engaging in meaningful social interactions,   spending time with loved ones, and nurturing relationships can  stimulate dopamine release and promote feelings of happiness and    well-being.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek  pleasurable experiences:&lt;/strong&gt; Engage in activities that bring you joy   and pleasure, whether it&amp;#39;s playing a musical instrument, dancing,   painting, or engaging in hobbies you are passionate about. Enjoying     pleasurable experiences can enhance dopamine release.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit excessive dopamine-depleting behaviors:&lt;/strong&gt; Certain behaviors like    excessive consumption of alcohol, drug use, and excessive gambling  can deplete dopamine levels over time. Moderation and balance are   key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I was on the one month depot of 50 for 7 years and came off it believing I wouldn&amp;#39;t relapse after so long and actually did relapse so they upped my dosage when I finally agreed to go back on it and have yet to bring it down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is what side effects do you guys suffer if you&amp;#39;re on this medication? Has it helped you? Is there better options out there? I know it depends on the person&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My episodes generally begin with hearing a voice in my head that isn&amp;#39;t attributed to me telling me that there&amp;#39;s technology out there that allows for mind to mind communication and do I want to be a part of it. Then when I refuse the voices turn on me and become negative. Anyone else have similar delusions?&lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"It sucks. I've been dealing with this since last year, and I don't know what to do about it.  


I know part of it is that I was ""drinking"" for a while in order to get rid of the visions and hallucinations. I recently quit a few days ago because I was doing it to the point where I passed out. My meds have not fully taken away the hallucinations, and drinking was the only way to get rid of it.  


But even prior to that, I was getting violent headaches. I went through several med switches that gave me the dreaded ""brain fog"", where I feel like my total recall is shot, sometimes I can't keep up etc. Light can hurt, but only certain types of light (I'm fine with the outside sun, but certain bubbles are just blinding). My visions have bad this year too. And they are increasing. I'll have them at night sometimes, and they are extremely powerful and give me a searing headache.  


Day to day life is fairly blurry- which is hard to explain. Part of it I know is the dissociation. What sucks about all this is that I'm working a job that requires me to be ""on"". I have to be able to memorize a lot of information, know different clients, do a lot of paperwork and data running, and I'm constantly having information thrown at me. I feel like I'm actually good at my job? And I'm getting better every day, but I hate the ""lazy"" or ""little"" mistakes I make. I feel like I can't win. I can do 9 things right, then forget the 10th because I honestly don't recall it. And I know it's frustrating to everyone. Which just makes my paranoia worse, like I feel like everyone hates me, and that results in guilt and shame etc.   


It just sucks. I'm tired of headaches, of not remembering... I love my job but it makes me not want to go to work, which is a problem because I have to work. I wish I could just... stay home? Be a little housewife, bake cookies, have babies, lead a life of very little stress. I just can't with this memory fog.

I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with this since last year, and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do about it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know part of it is that I was &amp;quot;drinking&amp;quot; for a while in order to get rid of the visions and hallucinations. I recently quit a few days ago because I was doing it to the point where I passed out. My meds have not fully taken away the hallucinations, and drinking was the only way to get rid of it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even prior to that, I was getting violent headaches. I went through several med switches that gave me the dreaded &amp;quot;brain fog&amp;quot;, where I feel like my total recall is shot, sometimes I can&amp;#39;t keep up etc. Light can hurt, but only certain types of light (I&amp;#39;m fine with the outside sun, but certain bubbles are just blinding). My visions have bad this year too. And they are increasing. I&amp;#39;ll have them at night sometimes, and they are extremely powerful and give me a searing headache.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day to day life is fairly blurry- which is hard to explain. Part of it I know is the dissociation. What sucks about all this is that I&amp;#39;m working a job that requires me to be &amp;quot;on&amp;quot;. I have to be able to memorize a lot of information, know different clients, do a lot of paperwork and data running, and I&amp;#39;m constantly having information thrown at me. I feel like I&amp;#39;m actually good at my job? And I&amp;#39;m getting better every day, but I hate the &amp;quot;lazy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;little&amp;quot; mistakes I make. I feel like I can&amp;#39;t win. I can do 9 things right, then forget the 10th because I honestly don&amp;#39;t recall it. And I know it&amp;#39;s frustrating to everyone. Which just makes my paranoia worse, like I feel like everyone hates me, and that results in guilt and shame etc.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just sucks. I&amp;#39;m tired of headaches, of not remembering... I love my job but it makes me not want to go to work, which is a problem because I have to work. I wish I could just... stay home? Be a little housewife, bake cookies, have babies, lead a life of very little stress. I just can&amp;#39;t with this memory fog.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My psychiatrist told me it was normal, which meds to take at night etc. I&amp;#39;ve tried adjusting them but nothing helps.  &lt;/p&gt;

,schizophrenia,"When I was going through my psychosis one form my voices would take is that I would hear real people say things about me when I walked by them. These people might be with each other or by themselves but I would always hear comments related to me or what I was doing. I've never been sure if this is part of my hallucinations because I also have autism which can cause auditory processing issues/ differences.

For example the majority of my voices were disembodied. There was no real life person attached to them. Other voices were within other sounds like running water or traffic but these would repeat the same things as the disembodied voices. It is only the category of voices that come from real people that confuse me. 

In the last week alone I have witnessed several people comment on me when I walk by them and these are complete strangers. I've heard people nudge their friend and say oh look to the right in the direction that I'm walking. I heard someone who lives opposite me say when I walked by that I'm always looking out the window and I'm probably a rat which means a snitch. When I was walking my dog there were some trucks and building vehicles so I decided to take a detour around them but then I heard the builders make comments when I did that at first and then when I came back from my walk later and walked by them again I heard them say things like well he's just a kid and there's his dog or something along those lines. I feel like in general people seem to bother or harass me. But I also think that I simply stand out and for some reason people stare or notice and then decide to make comments either directly to me or to the person they're with about me.

This is something that has been going on for such a long time. I've only noticed it happening more this week but I know that it used to happen when I was a teenager too. I understand that it seems unlikely for this to be happening so frequently but that's why I want to know is it possible that hearing people comment on me when I walk by is an auditory processing issue due to the fact that I'm autistic and I'm mistaking the words they are actually saying or is it a consistent hallucination that I've been having for about 15 years or more?

Lately I just feel like people have been going out of their way to he nasty to me when I don't bother a soul and I'm always out on my own.

For example my first psychosis. I was 17 in High School after my two friends died the year before, and I heard a voice in church plus had a hallucination at one of my friends funeral. It was a voice that told me it was God, and talked to me a lot since his funeral in my brain comforting me.

,schizophrenia,"Hello!

There have been a growing number of Discord and various social software invites posted of late.

We'd like to cut down on the noise, and facilitate making it easy for people to both advertise and discover the plethora of social media groups and Discord servers you all run.

There are some proposed ground rules for this new initiative:

* Invites must only be posted to the monthly Megathread. A new thread will be posted on the 1st of the month at 6pm London time.
* Please post a direct invite link for your server / group, and avoid practices such as asking people to message you in private.
* Because private groups do sometimes result in drama, or unhealthy environments, you must be open to an r/schizophrenia moderator freely wandering in to check it out, if we receive any complaints or safety concerns are raised.

,schizophrenia,"Hi guys,

I hope you are doing well and not letting this disease get the best of you (so many amazing, kind, smart, and brave people on here, you inspire me!). Lately, I am starting to realize that the avolition and anhedonia I feel is not from my medication (I take about 2 mg of olanzapine daily) but is rather the negative symptoms I experience after my last Really bad psychosis. I think it gave me some sort of brain damage because it was so wild and crazy what i went through. The reason for my conclusion comes from the fact that these couple of days I took less olanzapine and I didn't feel any better, in fact, i even felt more depressed. I was wondering if my brain will ever feel better. I used to be a happy individual with so many interests. Most importantly I was very active and i found so much joy in moving, now moving is simply painful. Do our brains have the capacity to heal and get better? 

Also, I keep thinking what happened to me last year, how could my psychosis been so so bad but now I am Ok on such a small amount of medication? Before my psychosis I smoked an obscene amount of pot, like chain smoking day and night, sometimes the pot would not even be from a good source or from god knows where.. Is it possible that what happened to me was drug-induced psychosis and maybe even if i have schizophrenia if i stay away from drugs and stress maybe it could be managed on relatively small doses of APs? 

I hope all of you are doing well. Also, wanted to update that i finally tried Vraylar but it made me bed bound, i was not willing to sit with the side effects for a while to see if maybe the drug could work for me, I decided to stop taking it and talk to my doctor see what could be done about it.

,schizophrenia,"Although easier said than done, these tips can enhance dopamine levels and keep energy levels up until you are able to adjust to your medications dopamine reducing effects. Most medication cause low energy levels, fatigue, inability to focus and stay alert. These key points if put into motion can counter these side effects.

If you have any tips or routines that help you keep your energy/motivation levels up, please do share them in this thread.  


**Suggested Routine to naturally boost dopamine levels**

**Morning:**

* 	Start the day with 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such 	as a brisk walk or a workout routine. This can help increase 	dopamine levels and promote overall well-being.
* Consume a 	balanced breakfast that includes foods rich in tyrosine, such as 	eggs, lean meats, or legumes. Include fruits or vegetables for added 	antioxidants.  
 

**Daytime:**

* 	Throughout the day, practice stress management techniques whenever 	needed. Take short breaks to engage in deep breathing exercises, 	meditation, or mindfulness to reduce stress levels and support 	dopamine balance.
* Stay 	hydrated and consider replacing caffeinated beverages with herbal 	tea or water.  
 

**Afternoon:**

* Take a 	break for creative activities or hobbies that bring you joy. This 	can include listening to music, painting, writing, or engaging in 	any other creative pursuits that stimulate dopamine release.

&amp;#x200B;

**Evening:**

* Allocate 	time for socializing with friends or loved ones. Plan activities 	like going for a walk together, having a meal, or engaging in 	meaningful conversations that promote positive social interactions 	and support dopamine levels.  
 

**Night:**

* Before 	bedtime, create a calm and conducive environment for quality sleep. 	Establish a regular sleep schedule and aim for 7-9 hours of 	uninterrupted sleep. Avoid the use of caffeine or ephedrine in the 	evening, as they may interfere with sleep quality and dopamine 	regulation.  
 

**Dopamine Enhancing Dietary Overview**

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Proteins:** 	Foods rich in proteins provide the necessary building blocks for 	dopamine synthesis. Include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, 	legumes, and dairy products in your diet.  
 
2. **Tyrosine-rich foods:** Tyrosine is an amino acid involved in dopamine synthesis. 	Foods such as almonds, avocados, bananas, eggs, chicken, and turkey 	are good sources of tyrosine.  
 
3. **Leafy greens:** Dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, and collard greens 	contain high levels of folate. Folate is important for 	neurotransmitter synthesis, including dopamine.  
 
4. **Fruits and vegetables:** Berries, particularly blueberries, are rich in 	antioxidants and may have neuroprotective effects, promoting brain 	health. Other fruits and vegetables, such as oranges, tomatoes, and 	bell peppers, provide essential vitamins and minerals that support 	dopamine function.  
 
5. **Nuts and seeds:** Almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds are rich 	in nutrients like magnesium, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids, which 	are beneficial for brain health and neurotransmitter function.  
 
6. **Dark chocolate:** Dark chocolate contains compounds like flavonoids and 	phenylethylamine (PEA), which may help enhance mood and support 	dopamine release. Choose dark chocolate with a high cocoa content 	(70% or higher) and consume in moderation.  
 
7. **Green tea:** Green tea contains an amino acid called L-theanine, which 	has been shown to have a positive impact on dopamine levels and 	brain function. It can promote relaxation while enhancing alertness.  
 
8. **Turmeric:** 	Turmeric contains curcumin, a compound known for its 	anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It may help protect 	dopamine-producing neurons and support overall brain health.  
 
9. **Probiotic-rich foods:** Emerging research suggests a link between gut health and 	dopamine production. Including fermented foods like yogurt, 	sauerkraut, kimchi, and kefir in your diet can support a healthy gut 	microbiome, which may indirectly influence dopamine levels.  
 
10. **Water:** 	Staying hydrated is essential for optimal brain function, including 	neurotransmitter synthesis and release. Make sure to drink an 	adequate amount of water throughout the day.  
 

**Other Considerations: Enhance and Maintain dopamine levels**

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Regular exercise:** 	Engaging in aerobic exercises like running, swimming, or cycling can 	stimulate dopamine release and promote overall brain health. Aim for 	at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the 	week.  
 
2. **Get enough sleep:** Quality sleep is essential for proper 	neurotransmitter function, including dopamine regulation. Aim for 	7-9 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night to support optimal brain 	health.  
 
3. **Manage stress:** Chronic stress can negatively impact dopamine levels. 	Explore stress-reducing techniques such as meditation, deep 	breathing exercises, yoga, or engaging in hobbies and activities you 	enjoy.  
 
4. **Listen to music:** Listening to music you love can induce pleasure and 	increase dopamine release. Choose music that uplifts your mood and 	makes you feel good.  
 
5. **Set and 	achieve goals:** Accomplishing goals, both big and small, can 	activate the brain's reward pathways and boost dopamine levels. 	Break larger goals into smaller, achievable tasks to experience a 	sense of accomplishment along the way.  
 
6. **Practice	mindfulness:** Mindfulness exercises, such as meditation or 	mindful breathing, can help improve dopamine receptor sensitivity 	and enhance overall well-being.  
 
7. **Spend time in nature:** Being in nature has been shown to have a 	positive impact on mood and overall brain health. Take walks in 	green spaces, go hiking, or simply spend time outdoors to 	potentially increase dopamine levels.  
 
8. **Socialize and connect:** Engaging in meaningful social interactions, 	spending time with loved ones, and nurturing relationships can 	stimulate dopamine release and promote feelings of happiness and 	well-being.  
 
9. **Seek  pleasurable experiences:** Engage in activities that bring you joy 	and pleasure, whether it's playing a musical instrument, dancing, 	painting, or engaging in hobbies you are passionate about. Enjoying 	pleasurable experiences can enhance dopamine release.  
 
10. **Limit excessive dopamine-depleting behaviors:** Certain behaviors like 	excessive consumption of alcohol, drug use, and excessive gambling 	can deplete dopamine levels over time. Moderation and balance are 	key.",t2_mrnnl,False,,0,False,Dopamine Enhancing routine/diet to combat energy draining effects of anti-psychotic medication,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,False,t3_1494mg2,False,light,0.89,,public,12,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice / Encouragement,False,12,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1686739474.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although easier said than done, these tips can enhance dopamine levels and keep energy levels up until you are able to adjust to your medications dopamine reducing effects.

,schizophrenia," I am annoyed by attempts to bring schizophrenia into the clinical space of minor psychiatry for the sake of moderating public opinion. I swear, soon the whole thing will be passed on to social workers and psychotherapists. The tendency towards the ""neutering"" of schizophrenia results in underestimation of its severity, blurring of diagnostic criteria, frivolous statements lsuch as “they just need love,"" ""they are at their lowest"" and other examples of so called tolerance, in which there is no understanding of this complex phenomenon, rooted in the very essence of human nature. And from here there is the image of a convenient, ""adequate"" schizo: a little ragged and despirited, yet functional for the most part. And these are the type of patients we protect legally. We're talking about people who had a couple of flare-ups, who blog, give interviews, complain and demonstrate other wonders of critical thinking. Psychotics so light and formal they were allowed to step within the boundaries of normativity, while the  true madness was left in the taboo area. 

 Don't get me wrong, it's great that we see the chance of rehabilitation for hose suffering from severe mental illness, but ... what about the chronic ones: filthy lost vagrants, institutionalized patients who never leave their beds? How long will it take us to start looking for an approach to these people?

,schizophrenia,"It sucks. I've been dealing with this since last year, and I don't know what to do about it.  


I know part of it is that I was ""drinking"" for a while in order to get rid of the visions and hallucinations. I recently quit a few days ago because I was doing it to the point where I passed out. My meds have not fully taken away the hallucinations, and drinking was the only way to get rid of it.  


But even prior to that, I was getting violent headaches. I went through several med switches that gave me the dreaded ""brain fog"", where I feel like my total recall is shot, sometimes I can't keep up etc. Light can hurt, but only certain types of light (I'm fine with the outside sun, but certain bubbles are just blinding). My visions have bad this year too. And they are increasing. I'll have them at night sometimes, and they are extremely powerful and give me a searing headache.  


Day to day life is fairly blurry- which is hard to explain. Part of it I know is the dissociation. What sucks about all this is that I'm working a job that requires me to be ""on"". I have to be able to memorize a lot of information, know different clients, do a lot of paperwork and data running, and I'm constantly having information thrown at me. I feel like I'm actually good at my job? And I'm getting better every day, but I hate the ""lazy"" or ""little"" mistakes I make. I feel like I can't win. I can do 9 things right, then forget the 10th because I honestly don't recall it. And I know it's frustrating to everyone. Which just makes my paranoia worse, like I feel like everyone hates me, and that results in guilt and shame etc.   


It just sucks. I'm tired of headaches, of not remembering... I love my job but it makes me not want to go to work, which is a problem because I have to work. I wish I could just... stay home? Be a little housewife, bake cookies, have babies, lead a life of very little stress. I just can't with this memory fog.

These people might be with each other or by themselves but I would always hear comments related to me or what I was doing. I've never been sure if this is part of my hallucinations because I also have autism which can cause auditory processing issues/ differences.

Other voices were within other sounds like running water or traffic but these would repeat the same things as the disembodied voices.

,schizophrenia,"In 2021 I was diagnosed schizoaffective bipolar based off the implications that I was telling the doctors I was psychic hallucinating, and delusional talking to, seeing spirits or angels.

Basing my actions off these conversations with spirits, and which in my past got me arrested. 

For example my first psychosis. I was 17 in High School after my two friends died the year before, and I heard a voice in church plus had a hallucination at one of my friends funeral. It was a voice that told me it was God, and talked to me a lot since his funeral in my brain comforting me. 

I was in class when I heard a loud thunderous voice coming from above talking about how a telephone in front of me was going to ring in 10 seconds. I counted down, and it rang. So I got up, and followed this voices every command thinking it was God.

I've heard now that there are malevolent aliens, and I was thinking about how maybe this is what happened. I was crying, praying out to the world inside my head and I heard a voice. This voice I trusted as God but it ended up decieving me, and told me great truths plus showed me wonderful things. What if it was just a bad alien posing as a good person interfering with me. 

If the governments has knowledge of aliens for over a century, and the vatican was invovled then there might be a better explination for relgion. This could explain my psychosis, and those alike. Why I was talking to a voice in my head. What was this voice inside my head that wasn't mine, and where was it coming from? How did did it tell me the truth, and then watch me intentionally suffer? 

Then you would also have to think maybe that this was God trying to talk or contact me, and that I'm not all insane. What happened just got confused when I was arrested, and I got arrested because they thought I was on LSD when I was schizophrenic having an episode.

,schizophrenia,"Please no ""you're not as alone as you think"" or ""I'm sure you're not THAT lonely"" comments, they're way more condescending and unhelpful than you think. 

I have tried everything I can within my power to find a companion irl for the last 6+ years and nothing. The closest I got was I met someone at a party a few months ago and they wanted to be my friend for three weeks. That's the cut off time the entity gives me.  Online or irl.

I want a genuine connection and you can't really get that from a ""if anyone wants to message me hmu"" interaction on the internet. Though to be honest I'd be down for any kind of irl friendship even if it's not that intense. 

When trying to use apps made specifically to make friends in my area the apps ALWAYS glitch out somehow. I mean this in no exaggeration. I'm not saying thank sign up for these apps and nobody swipes I'm saying that EVERY time there are insane technical issues stopping it from working. From it telling me there's no memory when I have 3gb free and the app is miniscule, to the app just refusing to believe me when I say it has permission to upload a picture. A very common one is I'll put up the most crystal clear photo of myself and the app tells me that it's a bad quality photo or not even trust that it's a picture of a person. I'm not even ugly, I'm fairly attractive, so what the hells the problem can cameras just not handley ethereal handsomeness or is almost every app under the same weird bias?

,schizophrenia,"I am just writing to share my experience here in case it helps anything.

I work for a pharmaceutical company. My clients include a producer of an antipyschotic drug and a mobile health app. The mobile health app has recently been updated and the new version tested in a clinical trial. This coincided perfectly with my increasing paranoia of employee monitoring software to the point I had a full scale mental breakdown. I didn't sleep or eat for 4 days, and have not really been right since.

My delusions led me to believe I was taking part in a clinical trial, where we were developing a new digital solution that allowed the patients to uncover repressed memories.

I believed that the work I was doing wasn't actually real, and that the clients and co-workers we're all involved in the clinical trial as undercover support staff. When I was working on the laptop, prompts and notifications would happen as a direct result of my activity (if I was writing a good email, the green arrows from the Microsoft Watchlist Stocks and Shares Widget would appear, if I was doing a mistake, the down red arrow would appear. The weather widget represented my managers emotion, rain for sadness, thunder for trouble etc.)

I came to believe that the technology was built to increasingly build connections between your behaviour and the prompts until a physiological break occurs. You'd be forced into a detached state away from your laptop. During which, your connections would re-establish themselves to repressed memories and you'd remember past traumatic experiences. 

In my case, I walked through the kids section at a supermarket and later saw someone looking at a bottle of whisky. At that point it clicked , I remembered that my grandad was a drunk who had abused me and that was the reason for whatever my issues had been.

My girlfriend had been looking after me at the time and it became apparent that she was also involved in this. She was secretly a 36 year old nurse (I figured it out because she once told me a story that her friend was going out with a 28 year old, but when she looked at his passport he was really 36). 

I made more and more connections which proved my suspicions. Anyone who disagrees was in on it in some way. The mental health unit that helped me were so efficient and helpful there was no possible way they could have not been involved. 

It reached the point where I realised I was actually 36, my family had all died in an accident, my girlfriend was also dead (possibly when she went on holiday on her own) and I had steadily gone mad in isolation.

Eventually I realised that I was in fact dead, or perhaps in a coma. traffic lights and car indicators were signs I was doing a good job or a bad job (while on life support). 

Anyway, I'd been prescribed medication at that point and it slowly started to work. Within a few weeks, I was functioning again and touch wood everything has been okay. 

It seemingly came out of nowhere, and for a few days something was violently pulling me into another reality. I was spiraling to find an answer how this could be happening to me, and the reasons became more and more insane as I fell into it. The rip cord the whole time was just ' You've lost your mind', but I could never accept that. 

It was a life changing event and everything is much better now. Ultimately, the main paranoia that I am going to die, my family are all going to die and my girlfriend is going to die is actually true, and the uncertainty is built in around that. You find connections to orientate yourself but they're only as real as you perceive them to be, but it's just something you have to live with. 

I don't know if this helps anyway but I hope it does, take it easy and try not to fret too much!",t2_93xmlpop,False,,0,False,Working from home,[],r/schizophrenia,False,,,0,,False,t3_148f7sz,False,light,0.6,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Introduction / New Member 👋,False,1,,False,False,,1686664542.0,,[],{},,True,,1686662103.0,text,,,,text,self.schizophrenia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am just writing to share my experience here in case it helps anything.&lt;/p&gt;
