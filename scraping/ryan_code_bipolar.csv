,bipolar,"Because I feel like I cannot and I’ve been researching extensively and obsessing to find any other reason that could explain my behavior and comin up dry…

I’m going through my last 12 years of life (I’m 29) and realizing that my “infinite energy” isn’t really my baseline mood because i inevitably crash… my version mania or hypomania ticks literally every single box (completely wreckless behavior, traveling all over the world never stopping, oversharing, prostitution, excessive drug and alcohol use, spending sprees on stuff for my sister, talking over people, hyper sexuality, feeling euphoric etc etc…) besides hallucination and hospitalization, even though I can check all of these boxes without a doubt in my mind I’m still convinced I’m making this all up and I’m losing sleep over this diagnosis.

Ik some of y'all will say I'm an idiot for not taking any kind of medication at all, no therapy or anything but it's...something just indescribable. I'm scared if I do those things that I would undeniably lose a part of who I am and just go down a different path in life. But the more time goes on the more it seems like damn...I might just need it.

Truth be told I never actually wanted to stop taking medication, I was just so afraid of hurting my mom emotionally and all these things...but apart of me feels like that's just an excuse for something else. I feel like I'm slowly ruining my life before I can even start it really and that I'm going to end up some loser until I die and will never accomplish anything in my maybe 50 years of life.

I don't want my life to stop over some dumbass disorder I got told I had; I'm still very young and the fact that I already have something like a mental illness on my shoulders feel so stupid.

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if it’s people pleasing tendencies or just pure guilt. I remember times when we would laugh and I wonder if I made the right decision. Does anyone else feel this way? I feel wrong for putting myself first and wanting to live life for myself. It seems silly but I wanted to hear other people’s perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

,bipolar,"Hi there-so, I don't really know where to begin or what to say, but I'll just start off with my diagnoses; type 2 bipolar disorder/ptsd/adhd/anxiety/asperger's and a couple of others, but am unsure if I'm wanting to share those (for now, at least). 

Long story short-I'd left an abusive situation a little over a year ago from a controlling narcissist who didn't believe treatment would help and immediately blocked them, to entering the healthiest relationship I've ever had in my life (a month and a half after that) with my supportive boyfriend who was my best friend a couple of years before. As well as extremely supportive family/close friends.

On top of the medications I've been taking (only for a few months), I consume Delta 9 THC which has helped me calm down from hypomania. This doesn't work for everyone and I'm definitely not saying to consume it if you're not comfortable-but this is just how it works for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also-I want to throw this out there and see if there's any similarities with anyone else, but my boyfriend AND my best friend have told me these when I've been entering hypomania;

\- twitchy hands (when standing still)

\- fidgeting in place / erratic behavior 

\- pacing the same path (without change in pattern or speed) 

\- incredibly fast heart-rate (my boyfriend was holding me and said that it felt like my heart was racing out of my chest)

,bipolar,"I'm just a major dumbass. I was manic for maybe 2 weeks or so, typical symptoms. No sleep, lots of ranting, lots of drawings and song writing and things like that. But seemingly over night yesterday I just crashed down and now I genuinely don't feel good at all today. 

Ik some of y'all will say I'm an idiot for not taking any kind of medication at all, no therapy or anything but it's...something just indescribable. I'm scared if I do those things that I would undeniably lose a part of who I am and just go down a different path in life. But the more time goes on the more it seems like damn...I might just need it.

Truth be told I never actually wanted to stop taking medication, I was just so afraid of hurting my mom emotionally and all these things...but apart of me feels like that's just an excuse for something else. I feel like I'm slowly ruining my life before I can even start it really and that I'm going to end up some loser until I die and will never accomplish anything in my maybe 50 years of life.

Ik the most logical answer is ""Just go back on pills dude, it's not that deep"" but something is just telling me once I cross that line I'm headed straight for some doom or something. I don't want my life to stop over some dumbass disorder I got told I had; I'm still very young and the fact that I already have something like a mental illness on my shoulders feel so stupid. 

Frankly I don't have enough courage to do anything with my life, and I'm finally at that age where I'm getting forced into slowly having to make big decisions. I don't have the courage to make a dream of mine true and I don't have the courage to go back on medication.

,bipolar,"Hi there-so, I don't really know where to begin or what to say, but I'll just start off with my diagnoses; type 2 bipolar disorder/ptsd/adhd/anxiety/asperger's and a couple of others, but am unsure if I'm wanting to share those (for now, at least). 

Long story short-I'd left an abusive situation a little over a year ago from a controlling narcissist who didn't believe treatment would help and immediately blocked them, to entering the healthiest relationship I've ever had in my life (a month and a half after that) with my supportive boyfriend who was my best friend a couple of years before. As well as extremely supportive family/close friends.

On top of the medications I've been taking (only for a few months), I consume Delta 9 THC which has helped me calm down from hypomania. This doesn't work for everyone and I'm definitely not saying to consume it if you're not comfortable-but this is just how it works for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also-I want to throw this out there and see if there's any similarities with anyone else, but my boyfriend AND my best friend have told me these when I've been entering hypomania;

\- twitchy hands (when standing still)

\- fidgeting in place / erratic behavior 

\- pacing the same path (without change in pattern or speed) 

\- incredibly fast heart-rate (my boyfriend was holding me and said that it felt like my heart was racing out of my chest)

,bipolar,"I am manic rn. I haven't slept in a few days. A common thing w/ mania for me is hypersexuality.

I've always been in monogamous long term relationships with friends, never been on a date or met someone outside a friend group.

I'm married. Happy to be married, can expound on that more, but my husband is very giving, sensitive, gentle, yet unfortunately suffers from low self esteem and a sense of timidness.

We haven't had sex in forever. I couldn't hope to tell you the last time we would have, like past a year at this point, and the last time would have been a 'quickie'.

When I'm not manic, I'm usually OK w/ it. I'm not 'happy' about it, but I don't think about it every day or talk about it all the time.

But when I am manic, I care soooo much. And I skip from how I think someone else might normally go 'oh this bothers me, it will build up slowly, I'll try to talk about it.'

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been in monogamous long term relationships with friends, never been on a date or met someone outside a friend group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m married. Happy to be married, can expound on that more, but my husband is very giving, sensitive, gentle, yet unfortunately suffers from low self esteem and a sense of timidness.&lt;/p&gt;

Took a week off for my mental health because I felt a manic state coming on after a particularly stressful week.

The last thing I needed to do was be forced to make a decision.

Against any sort of protocol (the union is now furious with him) my principal forced me to make a decision in the middle of my unpaid leave, that I took for mental health reasons, off school campus, in my the middle of a manic episode.

Really regretting my decision. Love my students and have been crying all week because they don’t want me to leave. I have a desk full of cards from them.

&lt;p&gt;Took a week off for my mental health because I felt a manic state coming on after a particularly stressful week. At the beginning of the week I honestly felt like I never wanted to go back because I was mentally stuck and I let my (acting) principal know this. The last thing I needed to do was be forced to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against any sort of protocol (the union is now furious with him) my principal forced me to make a decision in the middle of my unpaid leave, that I took for mental health reasons, off school campus, in my the middle of a manic episode.&lt;/p&gt;

Ik some of y'all will say I'm an idiot for not taking any kind of medication at all, no therapy or anything but it's...something just indescribable. I'm scared if I do those things that I would undeniably lose a part of who I am and just go down a different path in life.

Truth be told I never actually wanted to stop taking medication, I was just so afraid of hurting my mom emotionally and all these things...but apart of me feels like that's just an excuse for something else. I feel like I'm slowly ruining my life before I can even start it really and that I'm going to end up some loser until I die and will never accomplish anything in my maybe 50 years of life.

I don't want my life to stop over some dumbass disorder I got told I had; I'm still very young and the fact that I already have something like a mental illness on my shoulders feel so stupid.

,bipolar,"Hi there-so, I don't really know where to begin or what to say, but I'll just start off with my diagnoses; type 2 bipolar disorder/ptsd/adhd/anxiety/asperger's and a couple of others, but am unsure if I'm wanting to share those (for now, at least). 

Long story short-I'd left an abusive situation a little over a year ago from a controlling narcissist who didn't believe treatment would help and immediately blocked them, to entering the healthiest relationship I've ever had in my life (a month and a half after that) with my supportive boyfriend who was my best friend a couple of years before. As well as extremely supportive family/close friends.

On top of the medications I've been taking (only for a few months), I consume Delta 9 THC which has helped me calm down from hypomania. This doesn't work for everyone and I'm definitely not saying to consume it if you're not comfortable-but this is just how it works for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also-I want to throw this out there and see if there's any similarities with anyone else, but my boyfriend AND my best friend have told me these when I've been entering hypomania;

\- twitchy hands (when standing still)

\- fidgeting in place / erratic behavior 

\- pacing the same path (without change in pattern or speed) 

\- incredibly fast heart-rate (my boyfriend was holding me and said that it felt like my heart was racing out of my chest)

,bipolar,"I’m a 30M BP2 and I just graduated from a professional school. I got offered my dream job right out of school, good salary, benefits etc. I felt like everything was going great. However, for some reason the state board where I am supposed to get my authorization to take my licensing examinations is still holding my application for unknown reasons (I called and they won’t tell me anything). My classmates have taken their exams and are starting to be licensed. I can’t make full salary or receive my benefits until I pass my exams. I run out of health insurance next month right before I need my appointment to refill my meds. In addition today I found out my job offer is now in danger of being revoked because I still haven’t gotten authorization to test. All this stress is nearly pushing me over the edge. I come home everyday either almost in tears or ready to hit the next thing I see. I’ve started not sleeping well again and feel like I’m going hypomanic for the first time in a while.

However, for some reason the state board where I am supposed to get my authorization to take my licensing examinations is still holding my application for unknown reasons (I called and they won’t tell me anything). My classmates have taken their exams and are starting to be licensed. I can’t make full salary or receive my benefits until I pass my exams.

,bipolar,"I am manic rn. I haven't slept in a few days. A common thing w/ mania for me is hypersexuality.

I've always been in monogamous long term relationships with friends, never been on a date or met someone outside a friend group.

I'm married. Happy to be married, can expound on that more, but my husband is very giving, sensitive, gentle, yet unfortunately suffers from low self esteem and a sense of timidness.

We haven't had sex in forever. I couldn't hope to tell you the last time we would have, like past a year at this point, and the last time would have been a 'quickie'.

When I'm not manic, I'm usually OK w/ it. I'm not 'happy' about it, but I don't think about it every day or talk about it all the time.

But when I am manic, I care soooo much. And I skip from how I think someone else might normally go 'oh this bothers me, it will build up slowly, I'll try to talk about it.' I instantly go 'well this exact same day I want to go find someone to flirt and/or sleep with'. I've never done that, even when not in a relationship, but it's like I have NO boundaries immediately.

,bipolar,"A few months ago I had a full blown manic episode with psychosis. I was in a really good position in my life. I was dating, doing well at work, exercising regularly, and going out. But despite being medicated, I still had a bad episode.

During this episode I said some weird things. I accused some peers of things like poisoning me and said I was pregnant (awful, I know). I didn’t say this stuff directly to the people I was accusing, and the people I said this to aren’t even friends with the people I accused, so they might not even know I said this, but I still feel mortified. I know I was wrong for saying these things, but this was the first episode I’ve had with auditory hallucinations so my delusions seemed so real and I was extremely frightened.

I was episode free for almost five years, was in a different environment than which I had my last episode, and was really trying to preserve my new reputation and have a fresh start. I’m normally a really relaxed, “chill” person but now I feel like a basket case and feel seen as “crazy”.

I know everyone has moved on and I doubt anyone still thinks about my behavior, so I how can I finally move on from this?

I’m also a major perfectionist so I tend to linger/obsess on my faults.

,bipolar,"I was diagnosed roughly last year, and I have taken meds from Albilify, Lamcital , and lithium. (Don't remember exact names). I also take Concerta (ADHD meds, but they suspect I don't have ADHD)

For the most part, my mania and depressive episodes have gone. At least the emotional aspect.

I usually start manic episodes around  April and nothing even close to that has started. Just feel anxiety all the time. 

I still have a very difficult time doing regular things, like consistently keeping my house clean, working out regularly, eating properly, getting things done, etc. 

I barely do them. I have extreme anxiety before I do them, and I just can't start. And I only start when I realize that I am fucked and just start doing things during panic mode. 

So I feel like I am physically depressed while I am not emotionally depressed. My mania phase has completely gone and has not come back. I sometimes I wish I was manic, it was much better than now. 

I also feel like I don't want to get into social situations. I don't want to meet people unless I have to, and I don't even want to think about dating. When I was manic, I was dating around like crazy.

Obviously since I am not taking care of myself, I completely let myself go, I look old and ugly, and I am wearing the same shit over and over again, my hair is getting long and I am just extremely unhappy with the way I look. 

So, putting this altogether, it's giving me extreme anxiety. And therefore I am in this constant loop. 

I thought medication would help me stop behaving this way, but I still feel this aspect to be the same and in some cases worse. 

I told my doctor, and he said from a third-party point of view, he thinks I am doing well. I walk my dogs everyday for an hour or more. I am doing pretty decently at work. I ""try"" to be social by going out once in a while, etc. 

He told me that the only way I can get out of this ""slump"", as I call it, is through routine and discipline and there's like no ""meds"" that can make me motivated.

,bipolar,"So, I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 last April, and after hospitalization last month I've started a partial hospitalization program. The new therapists and clinicians I see there think I may experience psychosis, which is a totally new diagnosis for me. Admittedly I've had experiences since early adolescence that seem to fall on the psychosis spectrum: brief auditory hallucinations, intense fear that someone was in my home and I needed to hide from them (so I'd lock myself in a bathroom or closet for an hour or more), and intense, unrelenting anxiety that follows ""obsessive patterns.""

Admittedly I&amp;#39;ve had experiences since early adolescence that seem to fall on the psychosis spectrum: brief auditory hallucinations, intense fear that someone was in my home and I needed to hide from them (so I&amp;#39;d lock myself in a bathroom or closet for an hour or more), and intense, unrelenting anxiety that follows &amp;quot;obsessive patterns.&amp;quot; When I attempted suicide, I felt almost compelled to do it, not by a voice or anything but this feeling of inevitably and &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a burden and need to be punished.&amp;quot; Then in the hospital I had a horrifying vision, and after coming home I had the same vision and have had fear of the dark since (though it&amp;#39;s been less than 2 weeks).

,bipolar,"Hello. I was diagnosed Bipolar at 23 years old. Didn’t want to hear it. Then shit hit the fan that year. Long story short, I had a mental breakdown. Dropped out of college. Quit my full time job. Got a studio apartment I was nowhere near ready for. Got into heavy drinking. Got into drugs. Did a lot of wild/questionable things. 
Now we are here. 
I’m 29 years old. Married. Almost 5 years clean. Pretty much sober the past 3 years with the exception of a very occasional drink. Work a full time job. Go to therapy. My life is stable, I have a lot of coping skills, and I value all of this. 

That being said, I can see how my party girl days can definitely scream mania. However, in my stable life style, sometimes I question if I’m Bipolar…I do swing from long periods of depression/anxiety to periods of feeling “normal.” Now normal to me might be what the mania is? I feel happy, productive, motivated; but I also stay up a little later (and I mean a little- like I fall asleep at midnight instead of 10pm). I get big ideas, but in my head I’m justifying them as I’m not depressed- so get everything done! Clean, catch up on alllll bills, think about vacations, look into moving finally (we want to move in the next two years). I get pretty hyper about this stuff though and my husband says I pump the gas too fast when I’m feeling this way. 

So is this depression and I’m just emerging from a depressive episode…or is it actually Bipolar and my mania is just better managed due to using my tools? 

PS- I’ve tried a couple a bipolar medications, but I was allergic to Lamictal and Depakote alone made me very depressed. 
On the same page, I had what my doctor called rapid cycling on Zoloft and Wellbutrin by themselves. 
I’m also diagnosed ADHD, C-PTSD, and OCD. Only taking Buspar at the moment.

I’m going through my last 12 years of life (I’m 29) and realizing that my “infinite energy” isn’t really my baseline mood because i inevitably crash… my version mania or hypomania ticks literally every single box (completely wreckless behavior, traveling all over the world never stopping, oversharing, prostitution, excessive drug and alcohol use, spending sprees on stuff for my sister, talking over people, hyper sexuality, feeling euphoric etc etc…) besides hallucination and hospitalization, even though I can check all of these boxes without a doubt in my mind I’m still convinced I’m making this all up and I’m losing sleep over this diagnosis. 

I’m rummaging all corners of the internet to see what other people’s experiences with mania is because I’m just the type of person that cannot take anything at face value, and since there is no difinitive test for bipolar disorder my nerves are just shot looking for answers.

&lt;p&gt;I’m going through my last 12 years of life (I’m 29) and realizing that my “infinite energy” isn’t really my baseline mood because i inevitably crash… my version mania or hypomania ticks literally every single box (completely wreckless behavior, traveling all over the world never stopping, oversharing, prostitution, excessive drug and alcohol use, spending sprees on stuff for my sister, talking over people, hyper sexuality, feeling euphoric etc etc…) besides hallucination and hospitalization, even though I can check all of these boxes without a doubt in my mind I’m still convinced I’m making this all up and I’m losing sleep over this diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m rummaging all corners of the internet to see what other people’s experiences with mania is because I’m just the type of person that cannot take anything at face value, and since there is no difinitive test for bipolar disorder my nerves are just shot looking for answers.

,bipolar,"I'm just a major dumbass. I was manic for maybe 2 weeks or so, typical symptoms. No sleep, lots of ranting, lots of drawings and song writing and things like that. But seemingly over night yesterday I just crashed down and now I genuinely don't feel good at all today. 

Ik some of y'all will say I'm an idiot for not taking any kind of medication at all, no therapy or anything but it's...something just indescribable. I'm scared if I do those things that I would undeniably lose a part of who I am and just go down a different path in life. But the more time goes on the more it seems like damn...I might just need it.

Truth be told I never actually wanted to stop taking medication, I was just so afraid of hurting my mom emotionally and all these things...but apart of me feels like that's just an excuse for something else. I feel like I'm slowly ruining my life before I can even start it really and that I'm going to end up some loser until I die and will never accomplish anything in my maybe 50 years of life.

I don't want my life to stop over some dumbass disorder I got told I had; I'm still very young and the fact that I already have something like a mental illness on my shoulders feel so stupid.

,bipolar,"Hi there-so, I don't really know where to begin or what to say, but I'll just start off with my diagnoses; type 2 bipolar disorder/ptsd/adhd/anxiety/asperger's and a couple of others, but am unsure if I'm wanting to share those (for now, at least). 

Long story short-I'd left an abusive situation a little over a year ago from a controlling narcissist who didn't believe treatment would help and immediately blocked them, to entering the healthiest relationship I've ever had in my life (a month and a half after that) with my supportive boyfriend who was my best friend a couple of years before. As well as extremely supportive family/close friends.

On top of the medications I've been taking (only for a few months), I consume Delta 9 THC which has helped me calm down from hypomania. This doesn't work for everyone and I'm definitely not saying to consume it if you're not comfortable-but this is just how it works for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also-I want to throw this out there and see if there's any similarities with anyone else, but my boyfriend AND my best friend have told me these when I've been entering hypomania;

\- twitchy hands (when standing still)

\- fidgeting in place / erratic behavior 

\- pacing the same path (without change in pattern or speed) 

\- incredibly fast heart-rate (my boyfriend was holding me and said that it felt like my heart was racing out of my chest)

,bipolar,Hey all. I’ve been trying to feel better since I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 but it’s really hard to without a job and income. I quit a really good job at the beginning of my manic episode and haven’t been able to find one since. I have a college degree and can’t even find a retail job to hire me. I worked a serving job for like a week but it took more of a toll on my mental health and I felt degraded. This has caused me to be very depressed and suicidal. I only get interviews but no job offers. I’m halfway through the month and rent will be due soon. The only reason I’ve been able to get by is because of my mom and boyfriend.

,bipolar,"I am manic rn. I haven't slept in a few days. A common thing w/ mania for me is hypersexuality.

I've always been in monogamous long term relationships with friends, never been on a date or met someone outside a friend group.

I'm married. Happy to be married, can expound on that more, but my husband is very giving, sensitive, gentle, yet unfortunately suffers from low self esteem and a sense of timidness.

We haven't had sex in forever. I couldn't hope to tell you the last time we would have, like past a year at this point, and the last time would have been a 'quickie'.

When I'm not manic, I'm usually OK w/ it. I'm not 'happy' about it, but I don't think about it every day or talk about it all the time.

But when I am manic, I care soooo much. And I skip from how I think someone else might normally go 'oh this bothers me, it will build up slowly, I'll try to talk about it.' I instantly go 'well this exact same day I want to go find someone to flirt and/or sleep with'. I've never done that, even when not in a relationship, but it's like I have NO boundaries immediately.

Am I trying to blame my bipolar since I'm like whatever the rest of the time except mania, or am I using it as an excuse for not addressing it more w/ him when it's a problem regardless?

Dunno where to go from here :/ I'm in therapy and a terrible client bc my therapist says hey you need to talk about this, how did it go last week talking about this, oh you still haven't done it I can't think of another way to tell you to get over it and do it lmao",t2_q2p7d47p,False,,0,False,Is it mania or do I have a real problem in my relationship :/,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,,False,,,0,,,False,t3_149l9we,False,light,1.0,#ecb493,public,2,0,{},,d7d50712-4eee-11e1-9b3f-12313b08a511,False,[],,False,False,,{},Support/Advice :shy:,False,2,,False,False,self,False,,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Bipolar + Comorbidities'}]",{},,True,,1686781996.0,richtext,,,,richtext,self.bipolar,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am manic rn.

   And now I have to go to professors and ask for help again. When I feel like I don’t deserve it and when I feel like I’ve already asked for too much. And I have to cancel on friends when they’ll be graduating in a few days and moving away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know it’s all in my head and that if I just figure it out I’ll be able to function but I’m struggling to do that and I keep starting to panic bc I’m scared I can’t figure it out. And that makes it worse. And it makes me feel stupid and useless bc WHY CANT I JUST GET OUT MY HEAD AND FUGURE IT OUT?? I can do the work if I’m not like this but I haven’t figured out how to make that happen. And thats my FUALT and I should be able to fix but I’m still crying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is rant-y but some encouragement or kind words would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

So Ive been on 600mg of Seroquel XR for about a year now, but almost every time I take it at night and a wait a little (~1 hr) the sleepiness starts to settle in I start to get either 1) feelings of impending doom, like everything is gonna get f*cked soon or 2) how my life is a mistake after mistake, regret after regret. 

When this happens, I either go to bed and wake up feeling fine or it would last 1 or 2 hours then completely go away.

,bipolar,"I was diagnosed roughly last year, and I have taken meds from Albilify, Lamcital , and lithium. (Don't remember exact names). I also take Concerta (ADHD meds, but they suspect I don't have ADHD)

For the most part, my mania and depressive episodes have gone. At least the emotional aspect.

I usually start manic episodes around  April and nothing even close to that has started. Just feel anxiety all the time. 

I still have a very difficult time doing regular things, like consistently keeping my house clean, working out regularly, eating properly, getting things done, etc. 

I barely do them. I have extreme anxiety before I do them, and I just can't start. And I only start when I realize that I am fucked and just start doing things during panic mode. 

So I feel like I am physically depressed while I am not emotionally depressed. My mania phase has completely gone and has not come back. I sometimes I wish I was manic, it was much better than now. 

I also feel like I don't want to get into social situations. I don't want to meet people unless I have to, and I don't even want to think about dating. When I was manic, I was dating around like crazy.

Obviously since I am not taking care of myself, I completely let myself go, I look old and ugly, and I am wearing the same shit over and over again, my hair is getting long and I am just extremely unhappy with the way I look. 

So, putting this altogether, it's giving me extreme anxiety. And therefore I am in this constant loop. 

I thought medication would help me stop behaving this way, but I still feel this aspect to be the same and in some cases worse. 

I told my doctor, and he said from a third-party point of view, he thinks I am doing well. I walk my dogs everyday for an hour or more. I am doing pretty decently at work. I ""try"" to be social by going out once in a while, etc. 

He told me that the only way I can get out of this ""slump"", as I call it, is through routine and discipline and there's like no ""meds"" that can make me motivated.

,bipolar,"Hello. I was diagnosed Bipolar at 23 years old. Didn’t want to hear it. Then shit hit the fan that year. Long story short, I had a mental breakdown. Dropped out of college. Quit my full time job. Got a studio apartment I was nowhere near ready for. Got into heavy drinking. Got into drugs. Did a lot of wild/questionable things. 
Now we are here. 
I’m 29 years old. Married. Almost 5 years clean. Pretty much sober the past 3 years with the exception of a very occasional drink. Work a full time job. Go to therapy. My life is stable, I have a lot of coping skills, and I value all of this. 

That being said, I can see how my party girl days can definitely scream mania. However, in my stable life style, sometimes I question if I’m Bipolar…I do swing from long periods of depression/anxiety to periods of feeling “normal.” Now normal to me might be what the mania is? I feel happy, productive, motivated; but I also stay up a little later (and I mean a little- like I fall asleep at midnight instead of 10pm). I get big ideas, but in my head I’m justifying them as I’m not depressed- so get everything done! Clean, catch up on alllll bills, think about vacations, look into moving finally (we want to move in the next two years). I get pretty hyper about this stuff though and my husband says I pump the gas too fast when I’m feeling this way. 

So is this depression and I’m just emerging from a depressive episode…or is it actually Bipolar and my mania is just better managed due to using my tools? 

PS- I’ve tried a couple a bipolar medications, but I was allergic to Lamictal and Depakote alone made me very depressed. 
On the same page, I had what my doctor called rapid cycling on Zoloft and Wellbutrin by themselves. 
I’m also diagnosed ADHD, C-PTSD, and OCD. Only taking Buspar at the moment.

Then came december 2022, i was having some problems like low energy, not wanting to go to work, i talked to my doctor and he asked me to raise the dosage to 200 mg. Which i did.
In a few days i was back on my routine, working, having fun with my friends, started partying a lot was drinking and getting high often. One day my brother and few cousins confronted me that i might be becoming bipolar, i was totally ignorant to that, another day went by, i had a massive fight with everyone at my home and left the house.
Next night i took some mdma which totally went negative and i did a lot of stupid shit. Didn’t harm myself or anyone. My 2 friends were there who handled everything till i calmed down. Now i knew i fucked up and wanted to fix things in any way possible.
A cousin was there who went to my home and told everything to my family, who got me thrown in a rehab. I was picked while i was asleep from my apartment and thrown there, i belong to pakistan and the rehab experience was very miserable it was like being in a prison. I was kept there for 2 months on God knows what medication. Their diagnosis was “drug induced mania”. They didn’t even diagnose me with bipolar or anything else as this was the only isolated incidence i had.
Came back home, my family doesn’t want to talk about any of it. I didn’t go for any follow ups or take the medicine that they recommended.
I wanted to get through all this myself.
But its been 3 months now that i am out of the rehab, i am trying to be strong but i know i am super depressed. My legs keep shaking when i am sitting, i cannot find peace.

,bipolar,"My ex and I were together almost 4 years. 

Last year my diagnosis changed and my psych took me off my antipsychotic and mood stabiliser. After Christmas I began to unravel, coming off lithium I had my first full blown manic psychotic episode. 

When I’m manic I’m truly horrible. I am vile, capricious, psychopathic and verbally hostile. I am truly a disgusting human being to be around. 

My psychiatrist continues to be utterly useless despite me telling them I cannot come off my medication again. The true victim of my episode has been the demise of my relationship. My ex was far from perfect and had many problems of her own, but I cannot help but feel disgusted with myself for how I treated her. I only stabilised back on an antipsychotic recently, and by that point it became too much for her and the relationship beyond repair. 

Whilst I know my ex wasn’t the innocent party I cannot help but feel disgusted and ashamed of myself for how I behaved. It doesn’t help having a psychiatrist who refuses to acknowledge that my mania and psychosis were actually bipolar related. I had issues with substances during the relationship but I tried so hard towards the end to make it right, to get clean and to rebuild our relationship. 

I refuse to point blame at my ex other than for what is reasonable. She was a true hero dealing with me and I pushed her to the edge. I miss her in some ways but the decision to end things was right. 

What I cannot get away from is who I become off meds. Finally being stable again is frightening looking back. Ex tells me my mental health was no excuse, I’m inclined to agree.

,bipolar,"So, I brush and use mouthwash once a day. Flossing, ummmm, rarely. But for someone with bipolar who struggles *massively* with that type of stuff, I feel like I do ok! Cue going to the dentist yesterday for a cleaning and checkup after a year. I kid you not:

“Do you need me to show you how to brush again?” *mimes using a toothbrush* (Really?!)

“God, this cleaning is taking fooooorever. You really need to floss more.” *mimes flossing method* (Starting to feel a little attacked here)
