1,Wish I could stop laughing,"My inappropriate laughter is fucking me. It fucked me when I had a job and was trying to make friends with my coworkers (I laughed when a coworker told me he and his brother were suicidal when they were younger, I also laughed at other random times which made them call me weird). I do it around my friends more and more, so they just call me a schizo (in a joking way). They call me a schizophrenic for other shit i do too, since middle school. And I've started doing it around my family a bit more, they havent said anything yet.

But it's starting to get really annoying. I'll get pissed off at games or whatever, but then I'll start laughing which pisses me off even more because ""I dont want to be laughing rn cuz I'm pissed off."" Makes me wanna break shit. Makes me feel unstable. Unstable are a big thing with me anyways.

4,"how do you keep going with work, chores, errands, bills, meals, hygiene?","its all so difficult. i recently (in the past month) moved out of my childhood home, moved in with my partner, & got a new job. and ive always struggled with keeping jobs but now it will impact my life way more significantly if i quit or get fired. but when i came on i was only supposed to work 25 hours and then some people quit and they haven’t hired anyone new so im working 40 hours a week closing by myself. and its in a deli so im constantly frying, baking, lifting heavy boxes, doing industrial size sinkloads of dishes, mopping, using harsh chemicals that i accidentally burnt myself with, i get small cuts and burns constantly, im overtired and overwhelmed, i feel like wearing my hat and hairnet every day is causing hair breakage and acne and making me more insecure, but the point is its hard on my body and my mind to be working like this, and to be working this many hours. i feel like i dont have a life outside of work, im always too tired or depressed to do much. recently i was scheduled 6 days in a row and then 7 days in a row right after that. i cry every day. sometimes in the morning before work, sometimes on my breaks, sometimes in the bathroom or the cooler, sometimes when i get home, sometimes when im going to sleep. my partner tries to help and hes amazing and does so much for me (wakes me up gently, makes me coffee, makes me meals, drives me if i need it, lets me rant and cry to him, foot & back massages, offers to draw me baths, gives me encouragement and advice and love) but i dont want to put too much (everything) on him and wear him down, i need more of a support system. and he doesnt have every answer obviously, and ultimately cant fix what my brain is doing to me. but when i built up the courage to make plans with a friend on one of my off days, i was cancelled on. when i went to see my mom one day, which we planned ahead of time, she wasnt even home when i got there, i waited for hours before she arrived. ive been suicidal and depressed and the sudden onslaught of new stress is making me lose my head & im hallucinating a lot more & doing things i shouldnt be doing to make me feel some relief. it’s difficult to manage my symptoms when i feel like i dont have time to. ive been considering going back to therapy but im also feeling broke right now. i dont know where to go from here. feeling forced to suffer is taking a huge toll on me. fuck capitalism for making me have to endure this if i want to just live a simple happy life with my partner and our cat. and fuck schizophrenia and depression for making this so much harder.",schizophrenia
5,Need advice on schizophrenic mother,"Hello!

I hope I'm not breaking any rules and this kind of post is allowed in here!

My mother most probably suffers from schizophrenia and I am at a loss on how to help her. She hasn't been official diagnosed because she refuses any kind of treatment but I've talked to different psychiatrists who told me that her symptoms seem severe and ""most probably"" reflect schizophrenia.

She's getting older and it seems that her symptoms are getting worse by the minute. She's getting more withdrawn and her affect is getting so flat it seems she has no emotions anymore. She has no friends, her delusions are taking more and more hold on her while getting more bizzare, she's unable to trust anyone, she's getting more suspicious towards people and especially my father (who she lives with) and I think he's getting ready to leave her, which essentially would leave her without any support system whatsoever.

I've been no contact with her for a while because of the neglect I endured as a child but lately I've had more contact with her again. And I've decided that enough's enough and that I'm willing to try once more to help her.

I tried so many times to get her to gain some insight into her condition but her delusions are so strong that she blocks everything I say or do. I tried to get her to see a psychiatrist for something unrelated (she has insomnia, hasn't slept more than 4 or 5 hours a night for the last 30 years) but she finds excuses no matter what I try. If I try to challenge any of her beliefs she gets extremely hostile. She doesn't trust doctors, medicine or ""Western"" philosophy. (Even though we're from europe)

Anyway, sorry I digressed... Is there anything, literally anything, I can do, to try and get her help? Anything short of just getting her admitted against her will? She's not a danger to herself or anyone else (as far as I know) so there's no legal recourse anyway. Basically, is there anything I could do or say that would be helpful in getting her to touch ground again? She's so detached from everything that she doesn't even care how much it's hurting everyone around her. I'm just a loss.

Sorry this got so long and ranty.",schizophrenia
6,God is forcing me to watch flashbacks of my abuse. TW.,"God is forcing me to watch flashbacks of my abuse. He's forcing me to flash back. He's forcing me to relive my rape over and over again. I can feel the sensations and the smells. The world smells like feces, everything tastes like feces. The stench is so overpowering it makes me feel like vomiting. He's forcing me to relive the sexual assault. And I don't know if I can take it anymore. I might have to kill myself soon. Before he turns me into the evil monster he's always wanted me to be. God is an evil force, not a good one. He commands armies of humans enslaved to him against me. God's curse is known as psychosis or Schizophrenia but nobody will believe its sufferersm they dismiss them as crazy. Mental illness is what happens when God or a demon possesses you. God had smiled upon me, and I ignored it. This is the price I pay! He createth, and he destroyeth. I am in hell and he has sent me there for my sins, which I must now relive eternally. This is why I am raped. It is to torture me. A boy named Sebastian raped me when I was 16, and my life has never been the same. My family tortures me on god's behalf. My mother was a prison sent from God.",schizophrenia
7,Another day,"Need to get this Down. Need to hear it. Need to choose whether to believe it.

I start every day the same waking up thinking I made it to another day.

The emotions I feel dam right confuse me. Sometimes I don't even know who I am.

I think back remembering old memories as they become more distorted the more I think.

I say Im sick, while my mind is trying to convince me otherwise. I begin to walk through the day, shadows following me.

The voices have started but nobody with me. I'm unable to feel, paranoia of everyone watching me.

My inner sanctuary, my mind opened up for the whole world to read.

Feelings double bit by bit destroying me. I want to end it, poor oh selfish me for living.

For now I let my demons feed on my soul. Closest thing I got to not being alone.

I've lost my emotions so I seek what ever can feed me. Even though I know it will never be enough.

I try to make myself happy but I'm unable to reach it. I try to make myself sad, but I'm unable to feel it.

I walk around my own nightmare as nightmares become reality to me and only me.

Fallen into a abyss with no way out. Reaching out grabbing for someone that used to belong.

Keep seeing my life fade one by one. When will this craziness be undone.

Nothing ever makes sense. Closeing my eyes and my thoughts jumble around.

Open my eyes. I made it another day.",schizophrenia

Ive been staying at familys the past 3 days since i doubt i should be home alone right now. In case it gets too dark inside.

I dont know if its due to quitting effexor and geodon(with psych approval and urging). Or if im just breaking down again.

12,"Post TBI, PTSD, MDD","I feel like my brain shattered when I was attacked and fractured my skull. Like a part of my self fractured off the whole and is functioning inside of me - outside of my control. But I think it’s still me, it feels like I would imagine a split brain patient might feel. Though I don’t know. It’s like I have two streams of consciousness running inside me at the same time. I have control of the larger chunk, and I can hear the smaller part that fell off. It screams for help, especially when I have panic attacks. There are other times when I feel like I fall away and it tries to handle things all by itself, and I struggle to regain control and my own stream of thought. Sometimes I try to talk and a garbled stream interrupts and confuses me. Even now I feel like thinking this through, the other piece is trying to have internal monologue, but it’s garbled and indistinct, but it’s not the me that’s attempting to write while it goes on. The only clear and distinct words I’ve heard as a separate internal monologue were “help” and “help me”. It coincides with panic attacks and makes sense that I would be thinking those words at that time, but I don’t feel agency over those internal screams. I feel like me and SHE.

A lot has happened since the incident and I’m now struggling to function. I’m on an ankle monitor and can’t leave. I’m running into brick walls every time I turn to look for help. I guess I was just hoping for some insight from someone else who may find any of this familiar.",schizophrenia
13,Nice thing to do for someone with schizophrenia,"I’ve seen some posts on here asking for advice when a loved one has schizophrenia. I have never experienced active schizophrenia, so I don’t know what helps during a full psychotic break. But I have had non-bizarre delusions during mild, transient psychotic episodes. Like I was sure all my partner’s friends were mocking me. I had been sure I was being fired at work repeatedly even though my boss always gave me satisfactory performance reviews. I was sure the trees were watching us (okay that one I never told my partner but I told him the place made me uneasy and I needed to leave immediately).

And every time I was 110% convinced of a truth that had no evidence but felt flawlessly true in my mind, my partner never once laughed at me. He just validated my feeling of fear and then asked how we could solve the problem so I could stop panicking over it. I wasn’t even diagnosed at the time. I just had thoughts that ran away with me, and my partner listened without any criticism. He told me he disagreed with me about his friends hating me and encouraged me to hang out with them more to prove it. And he found activities that I enjoyed to do with his friends and we all began getting along. He would talk about my day at work and listen to things that I pointed out were clear signs I was being fired. He encouraged me to be assertive about all the good things I’d done and offered to help with my resume if I did get fired. I didn’t get fired I have been working there for 14 years with strong performance reviews. Since getting diagnosed I have worked with my boss about accommodations because I still struggle.

When there was no solution for the delusional paranoia eating away at me, my partner listened and offered me compassion. He also used boundaries when I raged, and I’m really glad he kept himself safe. He believed in me and supported me going to a psychologist for evaluation when I was panicking about a catatonic episode at my job.

My partner has always treated me as valid even when I had the most batshit thoughts. I am lucid now, and it means the world to me that he never saw me as inferior because of my thoughts and behavior. So I think that is my advice to people that have loved ones with schizophrenia. I remember everything from when I was psychotic, so please remember the person you love is still there and still valid. They are the person you love and they are stuck battling against a dysfunctioning mind.

16,Can Seroquel increase aggression and positive symptoms?,"My brother is taking Seroquel (or Quetiapine) for the second time for his insomnia and his schizophrenia and his whole demeanor has changed. He is not so laid-back as before, and he refuses to talk to me, is aggressive, plays the blame game and is not easy to talk to. I also noticed his delusions have increased, and he is unattentive, inside his own head.

I've seen similar behavior in him 7 years ago, when he took Seroquel. He had displayed aggressive behavior back then as well. I'm scared because he was throwing cups and porcellaine out of nowhere. I don't want this to happen again.

I tried to talk to him about the change in behavior and urge him to talk to his doctor but he doesn't listen because he ""finally sleeps well"".

When I searched up the medication online, it appears though to be a sedative and a suppressant of emotions, so it sounds contradictory. He doesn't give me any information about his intake regimen or his dosing. Should I try to call his doctor to give me more information and talk to him about this behavior?",schizophrenia
17,Dating while schizophrenic / PTSD,"Hi,

I was just wondering if anyone had any successes in making a relationship work with mental illness.. I used to be okay masking for a long time pretending to be happy with people but after a year or two I tend to fizzle out when I can no longer be their entertainment or happy go lucky all the time.

Wondering if there is any hope at maybe meeting someone as I feel like total damaged goods - it is hard to find people to relate to as so many are just out there living uninterrupted, free flowing, successful lives while I've been exposed to the most horrific things that people are capable of and once you've seen what people are truly like in this world it is hard to unsee it. I envy those people so much sometimes --

18,Help please?,"hey everyone. I’m writing this as a call for help please. I’m 20 years old (I have therapy later this week and will be telling therapist all of this I’ve never taken meds or seeked any special treatment only a therapist) . I pretty sure I’m schizophrenic but I feel it’s gotten bad. Im so ungodly depressed it’s not even funny. I have pretty much 0 social skills and can’t maintain a conversation to save my life. I isolate every single day. Hardly talk to friends and family anymore. My family is really big on quality family time; its a very important thing. I’ve missed my own nieces gender reveal, missed my family giving my dad a cake for Father’s Day I don’t go to any family events or gatherings. I MISS EVERYTHING AND IM SICK OF LIVING LIKE THIS. All because I sit in my room, just myself and my corrupted mind. I’ve always been kinda reserved. But nothing like the past 4ish years, and even more so the past 6ish months. You know when you have a really catchy song in your head? And can’t stop singing it in your head? My thoughts are like that, only I can’t stop or control them. I feel like they’ve gotten louder too. I disassociate so often throughout the day now my life feels like a dream. If I stare far out into the distance say like at a tree line I got such a weird feeling. There’s a lot more, but there’s only so much I can think of at a time before my mind draws a blank. Retaining knowledge and focusing is something also something that’s so hard for me. I want to just admit my self to a psych ward or something but I feel so judged if I tell family that I feel like I have schizophrenia. Like they’ll see me like a monster and/or give me some sort of pity. I don’t want pity and I’m not a monster. I just want to be “normal”.

Sorry this is kinda all over the place but I feel so much emotion and none at all at the same time and just write what I think and feel at the time.

Please tell me someone can relate and/or give me advice or words of wisdom or anything at all really. I can’t stand the thought of me not being here anymore and leaving my family broken. The guilt would follow me to whatever comes next.",schizophrenia
19,Is what I’m dealing with schizoaffective in your opinion?,"Hey all, I’m an 18 year-old guy. I’m an indie rock/psychedelic rock singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome when I was nine/about to be ten in 2012 and later autism spectrum disorder in 2018 when I was fourteen. I have a question. What do you think this is I’m dealing with? Do you think this could be an underlying symptom of my Asperger’s/autism or something entirely different that could be comorbid with my Asperger’s, such as schizoaffective? I hear faint male voices. They sound like narrative tape recordings that get the play button activated whenever a trigger occurs. For example, if I’m walking outside, they tell me that if I touch a leaf/it touches me or if my mom or another person touches my arm or something that I will transform into a leaf/plants will grow out of my skin/I will transform into that person/my arm will change into theirs in five seconds (I can see the countdown in my imagination) if I don’t count my fingers 18 times “to verify my age” correctly, go urinate, spit on my shirt, or blink 18 times. They also tell me not to step on certain rugs because they could be a portal to Hell. I have to walk around them, which can be very difficult. I used to be on Seroquel 100 mg, Lamictal 150 mg twice a day, and Luvox 50 mg. The Luvox was for OCD, which has been considered for the symptoms I’ve described. However, it seems to have made my voice louder and more demanding, so I transferred over to Invega 1.5 mg. a month ago and I got off another version of Seroquel, the extended release 50 mg. version. I’m honestly slowly starting to feel better. The voices started when I was eight years old. I remember the day exactly. I had seen “Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade” the night before, and it scared the absolute shit out of me (please excuse my language). The next day, I was listening to “The Boys Of Summer” by Don Henley, and that’s when I first heard (and imagined) the notorious “countdown” from the voices. So, I have a love/hate relationship with that song. I did not tell anyone about my voice(s) until I was ten. I was too scared to mention them. Soon thereafter, my pediatrician started me on Abilify at about 5 mg. I can’t remember the exact dosage. It made me gain a ton of weight and messed with my mental state terribly for the first four years, then I lost weight by removing sugar and gluten from my diet for a bit, from the suggestion of a neurologist in Nashville I went to (and plan to go back to). Abilify started to “work” per se then, although I didn’t like the way it made me feel honestly. I felt drowsy and almost robotic. I longer do that diet, albeit I work out multiple times a week now to keep myself in shape. When I was 17, I got off of Abilify and transferred to only Luvox at 50 mg. I felt terrible afterwards. I had no motivation to socialize, so simple things such as talk, eat, drink, and walk, no libido, and angry breakdowns were very common. So, then I started on Lamictal 25 mg. twice a day to alter my moods. It worked slightly, but I couldn’t sleep. So, soon thereafter, I got put on 25 mg. of regular Seroquel. I felt better, though my voices were getting worse. After my psychiatrist changed my meds the doses I mentioned at the top of this post, I felt wretched again. So now, I’m simply going to be on 1.5 mg. of Invega, as I also talked about above. My moods also whip like a pendulum. I can be perfectly happy one day, often to the point that I stay up all night listening to music and cleaning my room. My sexual libido also roars during this time. Other times, I can be pessimistic, unforgiving, feeling like I’m a cross to bear on everyone around me, even including my best friends, I feel I hate life, I yell and act curt over small things, my libido slowly dies, etc. My moods are very unpredictable. My psychiatrist diagnosed me with bipolar type II and OCD and later schizoaffective disorder after I was able after ten years to correctly describe what I was dealing with. Some OCD-like rituals I believe are things I came up with to alleviate the voices’ commands. The voices also tell me that I have to clinch my fingers a certain way on my pillow when I sleep. If they lose their form, I have to count my pinky fingers eighteen times often myriads of times as the “age verification” thing I mentioned above. Is the fear of transformation and the voice telling me to do things a certain way a symptom of my autism in your opinion, or what do you think it is? Does this sound like schizoaffective disorder to you, or what do you think I could be dealing with? Best regards, and peace and love! Ryan",schizophrenia

Am I actually rapid cycling?

I’m on lithium, risperidone and escitalopram and ok mood wide on average on those. Thanks!",bipolar
34,Any good blogs or channels about Bipolar you like?,"My daughter woke me up because our dog ran away and I can't fall vack asleep. Anything about the disorder... personal experiences or helpful info?

I watch one lady... her YouTube is I believe.. Living Well with Schizophrenia. Her subtle and not so subtle mannerisms and personality are relatable. I don't understand some of her psychosis... I don't have hallucinations and I don't think I'm so delusional. Everything else is very much like me and she is comforting to watch when I'm alone.

Hope you guys are finding someone peace tonight ❤️",bipolar

37,Navigating relationship with acquaintances that experienced my bad episodes,"I’m moving back with my boyfriend to the town that we grew up in together. His best friends live in our home town and I haven’t seen them since I’ve gotten better and on the right medication. I don’t remember most of what I said or did but I’ve been told of the things I’ve said were really mean and offensive. I wasn’t friends with them before and they don’t have a good opinion of me. They know my diagnosis, but I don’t know how much they know exactly. I want to apologize, but I don’t know what to do exactly. My boyfriend says to just let them see how I’ve changed but these are really important relationship to him and I just want to make sure that I handle it well. What is the best approach?",bipolar
38,Just about to go inpatient,"(am in the UK) went to accident and emergency on the forced advice of crisis team, lay on a stretcher in the hallway for 48 hours, absconded and am now waiting because an ambulance is coming in 45 minutes to send me inpatient. It's a ward I've been on before and really liked. I keep asking my friends, why am I being put into hospital? They just keep saying - you are not well. I don't feel ""not well""; I just feel angry that I'm in this situation.",bipolar
39,how do u keep taking meds without giving up and falling into despair?,"i feel like ive never found medication thats actually worked for me. im currently on abilify but theres no noticeable effect on my bipolar. each of my episodes just keep getting more and more severe. i feel so frustrated. i feel like shit NOW and life responsibilities keep coming at me and im incapable of doing them but i feel like nobody listens to me or cares, just dismisses me and says to just hold on. but capitalism and daily life responsibilities cant wait for me to ""hold on."" but i also know the right medication regime can take years to find. i just dont know if i even have years. its so easy to give up and go off my meds if they dont do anything for me. does anybody have any advice or words of encouragement?",bipolar
40,Plans,"I know this one

Routine as air in lungs

As I’ve always done

Have gravity for it

Feels obscenely wholesome

Knowing these thoughts

Introduced themselves frantic

Now they warn me less

Already read this plot

Rather typical of the lost

Just another step like others

Feel like my peculiarities presenting

Just another way I attend

These plans have me done.",bipolar
