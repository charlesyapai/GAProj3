omfg guys I'm actually so happy.. my mood has improved so much since getting on meds,
What are your telltale signs you’re going into a (hypo)manic episode?,I noticed today that I kept randomly laughing at stuff that isn’t that funny and that I’ve been singing and dancing more and more as the day progresses. My mood is also really good. I am wondering if I’m going into hypomania because this is how they started in the past.
How do you cope when you go from manic to depressed overnight?,I have been manic for two weeks and then yesterday I just fell off which isn't too surprising as I always get depressed after I've been manic.  I was writing like crazy for two weeks and then yesterday it was like there was just nothing left and I slept for 12 hours last night and then napped another two today.  I feel generally blah and apathetic and I don't want to do anything.  I know I should practice opposite action but I just have zero energy.  Any coping mechanisms?
Quit my job last week during an episode. Regretting it now.,"School teacher. Love my class, but I have a couple who have ‘the most extreme behaviour I have ever seen in 20 years’ according to my current acting principal."
Relationships?,"Does anyone feel like they will be a lone forever? I only try to date when feeling up. 34 M this is extremely depressing when I see so many others progressing through life and I am not, just the weird single uncle"
A lot happening,"I had a girlfriend/ maybe still have a girlfriend, And we went on break shortly after a med change and I think the start of a heavy depression starting. Everything happened at once and because of it I have been in a downpour of negative emotions. The rain helped me a lot more today then it did before. I’m not sure why rain helps me but I think it slows my thinking. Heavy downpour of rain and lightning algae always calmed me down though. I’m still figuring everything out too. I don’t know what triggers my episodes and I don’t know how to stop it. I was recently diagnosed and I’m still trying to figure everything out with medications. I’m just kinda sharing but if anyone has anything they would like to say that may help me figure more out I’d appreciate it."
Why do I think I have the power to sue anyone when I’m manic?,"Like I have one good lawsuit going how ever, since that lawsuit I go on rampages thinking someone did me wrong when I’m manic, even though they probably did . Which results in callings lawyers etc…..I find legal justice a must when I’m manic??? Idk if it has to do with people doing me wrong but I go on these rampages….wanting and gripping on to this sense of justice? Idk… can anyone relate I dead ass feel like Kanye west rn"
have you took a break from your medications?,"i’m not asking for professional advice because I’m seeing my psychiatrist anyways, but I’m thinking of tapering off the 200mg of seroquel im taking and letting my body adjust without any medication‘s because I’ve tried so many the past six months that I’ve been having a really hard time. i’m starting an intensive outpatient program soon in like a week where I can see a new psychiatrist sooner because mine said that she can’t help me anymore. she kept putting me on high dosages of the medication I was taking and it was causing not so good side effects. i’m just tired of being depressed. nothing i took helped my depression which is a major problem & im feeling manic as well. I am currently waiting on Social Security to give me my benefits because I have a disability with my feet and I also have bipolar disorder. however, I have no income at all and I depend on my mother, who has no money either. i’m really tired of having to wait and I really need to be a responsible adult. i need to be independent & support myself. I quit every single job and I’m never happy when I’m working but I’m also not happy being in my house all day doing absolutely nothing so I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m at a rock and a hard place. the meds really fucked me up. it sucks"
wow i really am bipolar,"the more and more i’m in therapy and able to feel emotions and see how i acted in the past and detach myself from my emotions and my actions…. i really start to see how i just fit right into a bipolar diagnosis. i’ve always doubted and been like omg what if i’m j being dramatic or my brain is tryna fake it or smth. but it literally all makes sense and a diagnosis is a comforting relief but it’s also like fuck, i’m fucked up and it ain’t going away"
Another day,
Good news,I think I've found a pretty good balance in my meds
I’m Manic!,"For the younger community in this group, do you guys hear everyone saying “I’m manic” or oh “I’m going manic”"
Exhausted all the time.,Does anyone else have their bipolar manifest is just being exhausted all the time? Like even when you're kind of wired and hypomanic you're still just exhausted. I recently had testing for narcolepsy because I just nap all the time. But it turns out when I think I'm napping. I'm not actually really asleep. I was told that being zapped of your energy is actually a very typical symptom of bipolar and sometimes it can mimic sleep disorders.
Diagnosed Today..,"I was diagnosed with ADHD/anxiety/depression 4 years ago. Recently I’ve been feeling like Ive had something else going on. I’ve done a ton of research and thought I had PMDD which is like PMS x1000. I have all the symptoms, everything points to that. I saw a new provider today and within 10 minutes of meeting her she said “has anyone ever mentioned you being bipolar?” It’s never crossed my mind, I’ve never had anyone mention it to me and I’ve seen quite a few therapists along with seeing a mental health NP every few months for my ADHD. Does this sound normal? If that is my actual diagnosis I accept it, but at the same time can it be that quick? Am I over thinking it? I’m going to seek out a new therapist an try to get an actual diagnosis from someone in the mental health field. To be honest I could see myself having it, but at the same time I thought it was just my ADHD and depression battling back and forth. She was no help at all with my questions and left me feeling worse than when I went in. I appreciate you all!"
I miss the mania,"I was manic on and off for 9 to 12 months and now I miss it. The doctors put me on Lithium which has worked but now I'm experiencing the lows and it sucks. And I miss the high feeling and elation of being manic, I wrote 2 books while manic and felt the best ever, on cloud 9, confidence was through the roof. I'm gonna stay on the Lithium because that's what's healthy for me but anyone else can relate here? Need to hear some other input on this. All of my confidence was gone now and I feel shaken. Also got divorced and lost a job. Gonna gain things back slow but steady...."
First time posting-here we go,"Hi there-so, I don't really know where to begin or what to say, but I'll just start off with my diagnoses; type 2 bipolar disorder/ptsd/adhd/anxiety/asperger's and a couple of others, but am unsure if I'm wanting to share those (for now, at least)."
Did you have success coming off medication?,I have been on 20mg olanzapine for 2 years now and I really want to try coming off it as I believe I am well enough now where I don't need to medication. I spoke to my psychiatrist about tapering and he was against the idea as the chances of relapse are very high he said.
bipolar in professional industries,"(sorry for formatting issues, I’m on mobile.)"
bipolar rage,"newly diagnosed. is this really a thing? i always thought i was just a shit person for becoming so ungodly irritated and angry sometimes and then i heard this term, how do i manage this? it’s slowly running my relationships with those around me."
How do I safeguard myself from acting on my urges while manic?,"This one’s a bit odd so apologies in advance if it doesn’t sound coherent. When I’m manic I usually get the urge to run away, as in take the car and go to another state entirely or get a flight overseas. I use Daylio too and have the habit of writing down whatever I am thinking for the day since I have trouble remembering specifics from day to day. This time when I came down from mania I know I had my usual urge to run away but when I looked back at my journal entries I had fully developed plans for leaving to stay at my grandparents old place (now abandoned) and how to get a flight to the netherlands and get to japan from there. This really worried me, and I tried to convey this to my husband. He just kind of brushed it off. He’s the one who usually keeps an eye on me during those episodes. My mom tries too but she has to deal with my dad and can’t often be present. I’m just really worried that I’ll actually act on one of my plans next time. Anything I can do to make sure I don’t?"
Job stress inducing hypomania?,"I’m a 30M BP2 and I just graduated from a professional school. I got offered my dream job right out of school, good salary, benefits etc. I felt like everything was going great. However, for some reason the state board where I am supposed to get my authorization to take my licensing examinations is still holding my application for unknown reasons (I called and they won’t tell me anything). My classmates have taken their exams and are starting to be licensed. I can’t make full salary or receive my benefits until I pass my exams. I run out of health insurance next month right before I need my appointment to refill my meds. In addition today I found out my job offer is now in danger of being revoked because I still haven’t gotten authorization to test. All this stress is nearly pushing me over the edge. I come home everyday either almost in tears or ready to hit the next thing I see. I’ve started not sleeping well again and feel like I’m going hypomanic for the first time in a while. My psychiatrist just left the practice too so I’m in a tough spot trying to figure out what to do without seeking emergency care. I’m at least thankful I have supportive friends and family who let me rant to a certain extent. The thought of losing my job because the state is inept at its job is just ruining me from the inside out."
Sense of self,
"My mind thinks so fast, I often miss the full context of a text and email - impairing my ability to do work (bp2 + adhd)","Hi,"
Summer,Does the nicer weather seem to cause episodes for you guys? Can’t tell if I’m just enjoying the nicer weather and feel happier/more productive or if I’m on the verge of an episode.
I’m scared of going to the psych ward,"Last time I was in the psych ward, a patient attacked me. The nursing staff didn’t remove them from the ward and now I’m terrified to go (I really need to go now) but I’m afraid of being attacked by someone again. Any advice or help?"
ADA Accommodations,"I’m curious if anyone on here with a white collar job has applied for and received ADA accommodations and if so, what accommodations were provided?"
Acceptance is friggen hard.,"Here I am, contemplating myself after smoking some weed that is probably bad for me. Thinking to myself shit, maybe the doctors are right. I'm impulsive with money. I don't sleep sometimes, I make stupid decisions. I've got trauma from past episodes and their fallout. I get anxious. I get really depressed. I enjoy my booze a litte too much. I've gotten locked up to a hospital bed against my will. Been delusional, paranoid, angry."
Mania has been getting embarrassing,"Gotta vent but my brain is in tangent mode so sorry if this doesn’t make sense. I’ve been fluctuating in a hypomanic-manic state for a couple of months now but I’ve been able to mostly keep things ok until the last month. I’ve definitely been fueling it and I know that but I’m just so afraid of the crash and I want to prolong that coming as long as I can. Drinking has been a big part of the fueling. I do embarrassing shit all the time when I’m in these episodes but last night I was told about something I had done and I feel nauseous over it. I’ve been seeing this guy, who I’m not even sure I should be seeing. He’s a regular at the bar I work at and I don’t ever go out with coworkers or customers like I don’t like to fuck with my money but here we are I decided to go out with him anyways this time. We’ve hung out a handful of times over the last couple weeks and the second time, I went to his place, we drank and had sex and I slept there then went home, just like the first time. But in the morning everything just felt off and I just didn’t feel super comfortable pursuing this and I kind of just decided to be apathetic about it and only go back over if he really pushed for it and if I was wanting the attention. Sounds shitty cause it is. Idc at this point. So I didn’t really talk to him for a few days and then he came into my work the next week and things felt ok again so I went over there after work and things seemed normal. So I proceeded like that one morning was just a fluke. Last night when we were hanging out he said something about “ it just kind of threw me off when you were laying in my kitchen alone” and I’m like tf are you talking about? And he was genuinely shocked that I didn’t remember. As he explained, suddenly the experience came back to me and I’m about to cringe typing it out. That second time I came over and things felt off the next day was because I had a fuckin panic attack and then my brain blocked it out ?? That night after we had sex, he went into the bathroom and while he was in there I began to have a panic attack (also I hadn’t had sex in over a year before hooking up with him due to trauma that isn’t fully resolved, clearly lol) so I went into the kitchen I guess idk what my thinking was. He said he came out and I was like nearly fetal position rocking and I was saying that I needed to leave but I was way drunk so he didn’t want me to drive. he coaxed me out of it and got me to go to bed eventually but OH MY GOD that shit is so embarrassing. I’m lowkey wondering what’s wrong with him that he’s still interested in me when that was the second time we ever hung out but like UGH this is the stuff that makes me not mix work with all of that now every time him and his friends come into my job I’ll know that they all know how unstable I am. Idk if I can even go see him again knowing that he already knows this side of me. Usually the manic pixie dream girl image doesn’t get ripped up this quickly lol most of em at least get a few weeks/ months of just the fun"
i can’t stop sleeping,recently i’ve been sleeping all day and all night. i feel like i can only stay awake for 2 hours and i’m not getting anything done. i always wake up feeling like shit and sometimes i feel physically sick too. has anyone else felt like this? how do you get out of it?
ECT is such an interesting ride.,"I’ve been trying ECT for a while, and I have to say it’s one of the neatest experiences I’ve tried."
Can stress trigger instability?,"Hey all.  Type 1 here.  I was wondering if constant stress every day can make your mood unstable.  Other people seem to handle it better without totally falling apart but I'm, not doing well to say the least.  I'm out of work due to health issues no doctor can explain and I think the routine of the same nothing happening every day combined with constant struggle might be making me sink.  Any advice on how not to reach the point of, doing anything drastic?"
I’m Hoping for a Break Through,I keep getting ECT and now that I no longer can get manic I feel like I’m no longer me. I keep going through the motions every day feeling Anhedonic and physically slower. All my music no longer appeals to me anymore and I can’t finish any video games anymore. I left my steam deck plugged in so long that it killed the battery. I told my psychologist I was hoping for a society break through and change on the level of the Industrial Revolution. I need to feel like progress is possible again. Apple shows of their VR Computing glasses recently and I’m so uninterested I can’t even bother to finish the video. I haven’t found a single book to finish in probably a year. Not a single book. I feel like all we’re doing is just rehashing old ideas or making changes that don’t really make a difference.
Agoraphobia accompanying bipolar?,I was diagnosed bipolar 1 with psychotic features just over 2 years ago after a psychotic episode. Since then I've been experiencing symptoms of agoraphobia that are only getting worse. I used to be able to travel up to 3 counties away from home without any issue. Recently it's progressed to the point I don't like going to my own town. I can. But it evokes so much anxiety when I do. And I NEVER drive myself. Is there a correlation between bipolar and agoraphobia? Anyone else experience this?
Mania or impulsiveness?,I have bipolar 2. Ive seen a lot of people say their mania is just impulsiveness….I’m getting confused myself when I’m in mania or am I just impulsive? Sometimes I feel like I have imposter syndrome. Please help understand the difference from the two or just examples😭😭
Therapy and meds help but I still don’t feel “right”,"I’ve struggled with BPD and Bipolar 1 for as long as I can remember, but I never wanted to have an official diagnosis. It wasn’t until last year that I was forced into therapy and got a diagnosis. Since then, I feel like I’ve improved immensely, but I still feel like something is off. I am happier and more stable since starting therapy and meds last year, but I still have SI, especially when times get hard. Last year during my birthday I had a slight manic episode and spent several thousands of dollars, and I’m paying for it now. I’m so stressed because of money but I feel like I can’t curb my spending, especially when manic. And then once realization hits I panic and freak out about the money and the debt I’m in. Money issues and stresses are on my mind literally constantly and I just feel like I’m drowning and I don’t know what to do, because I put myself in this situation. I feel like if therapy and meds were helping I shouldn’t have had a manic episode and spent so much. And when I do have issues I shouldn’t be having break downs and self harm thoughts. I’ve brought this up to my therapist but she continues to tell me my numbers are fine, and my psych won’t prescribe any additional meds because I’d be “over medicated” but I just feel like I’m still so out of whack"
"It's the 14th here, and it's my birthday","It's my birthday today, and I just turned 26. I used to think that I wouldn't make it this far. Or I guess, it was tough to think I'd live to see more beautiful things had I been unaware of having BD. Well... it's still tough, but I'm here!"
achey when depressed?,Just curious does anyone else get like muscle and joint aches when you’re depressed? It’s happened to me since I was a teenager and now it’s happening again on account of you know the depression
Is it mania or do I have a real problem in my relationship :/,I am manic rn. I haven't slept in a few days. A common thing w/ mania for me is hypersexuality.
how to cope with side effects from medication,"side effects are going to happen no matter what, yeah? well, does anyone have tips on handling depression when adjusting to medication?"
Sleep Eating,"I go through periods where I apparently ""sleep"" eat. I really don't remember doing it 90 percent of the time. I woke up this morning and my wife handed me a spoon that she found in the bed. It had remnants of peanut butter on it. I hadn't been doing this for months but it's happening again. I told the docs about it and my therapist. They said it's possible it's a side effect from one of my Meds. They didn't seem very confident that's what it is though. Any of you experience this? What did you do? Suggestions?"
Endocrinologist told me Latuda has given me low testosterone. Any one experience this?,Does anyone have any advice? I’ve been on Latuda for 2 years and my endocrinologist is saying it’s caused my testosterone to dwindle to significantly low numbers.
How to move on from manic behavior?,"A few months ago I had a full blown manic episode with psychosis. I was in a really good position in my life. I was dating, doing well at work, exercising regularly, and going out. But despite being medicated, I still had a bad episode."
Another drawing :),
carefree painting,
Every job manages to go wrong,"I’m 25. I’ve had countless jobs, but all of them meaningless. This is finally an entry level job for my field. All of my other jobs i’ve had to quit after a short time because i haven’t been able to handle it mentally. This one i thought was different. i liked the job itself. I was fine showing up everyday. i didn’t LOVE it (i’ll never love a job), but it was bearable."
Are you allergic to any meds?,"I found out that I am allergic to Lithium, Seroquel, and Invega. Lithium made me itch all over. Seroquel gave me a rash on my arms and legs. Invega made me itch all over. What about you?"
Coworker drama,"About eight months into working part time with all women at a rural daycare, I just said the reason that my schedule part time is because I am on disability and not allowed to work more. I worked somewhere else for a few months because it was a better opportunity but now that I am back at the daycare, everyone is treating me like I am super stupid and incompetent. A Third World citizen. I am not sorry that I spilled the beans that I am not perfect because I want to be proud of who I am and not ashamed. I don’t know how to deal with these women though. They are low education, low class and all competing for the kids attention. I don’t mind not being left with responsibility, but does anyone know how it feels to just be looked at by coworkers like you are nothing because of your Bipolar or disability?"
I've been waking up so incredibly early lately,"I was so worried I was entering a manic episode, I usually sleep in now that it's summer and I have nothing going on. I talked to my mun about it, how I keep waking up at around 7am every day and mentioned how I'm usually able to fall asleep after taking a trip to the bathroom and turning on my fan."
Mania and Hypo Mania,Hello All. This is my first ever post on Reddit. I am also newly diagnosed with BP 2. I was wondering if you would please share specific examples of what mania and hypo mania feels like. I don’t seem to understand what that it means. Thank you in advance.

It’s finals and I can’t stop crying,"Basically what is says there. I just cannot stop and I’m trying to work through it but it’s hard. I’m already missing things that I could have gotten done and I know I could get some more done but I keep crying and breathing fast and I haven’t been able to stop all day. This year I got diagnosed with BP2 right before my fall term of 2nd year college. And I’ve been struggling since. When I’ve talked to pretty much anyone about feeling like I can’t do academics, they offer help and accommodations. And so I try to do my homework and my tests and be a good student and friend and work too and now I’m at the end and I’m missing presentations and due dates and can’t make it to things with friends before they leave for summer and work and I can’t be what I’m supposed to be and what people have been trying to help me be. And now I have to go to professors and ask for help again. When I feel like I don’t deserve it and when I feel like I’ve already asked for too much. And I have to cancel on friends when they’ll be graduating in a few days and moving away."
Does anyone ever think that you either gonna achieve something big by working as hard as possible or you'll give up?,"Probably vast majority of people already  knows  $ui$ideboys music group, when they were completely unknown and no one would listen to them or even have heard of them they did set a goal which was crucial ""we either gonna be famous by the time we're 24 ( i might be wrong with the number of their age ) or we will end it all. And they did indeed became successful artists with the name suicideboys."
Feelings of doom/extreme regret after taking Seroquel,"Hi all,"
"Started meds maybe over a year ago, my mania and depressive episodes have gone, but my anxiety is still super high.","I was diagnosed roughly last year, and I have taken meds from Albilify, Lamcital , and lithium. (Don't remember exact names). I also take Concerta (ADHD meds, but they suspect I don't have ADHD)"
Psychiatrist appreciation thread,Just want to put this out there to appreciate those psychiatrists that are worth every cent we pay to them.
Bipolar 2 and psychosis?,
My brain is my worst enemy,"My brain prevents me from doing and progressing in the things I love. It prevents me from forming relationships. It prevents me from feeling motivated or looking forward to things. The second I stop distracting myself with meaningless things, I can’t control my emotions so I escape again, a never-ending cycle. I’ve fought so hard and yet am completely at the mercy of however my brain feels like working tomorrow. This disease sucks and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. Why does this shit exist?"
Can mania be subtle?,"Hello. I was diagnosed Bipolar at 23 years old. Didn’t want to hear it. Then shit hit the fan that year. Long story short, I had a mental breakdown. Dropped out of college. Quit my full time job. Got a studio apartment I was nowhere near ready for. Got into heavy drinking. Got into drugs. Did a lot of wild/questionable things. Now we are here. I’m 29 years old. Married. Almost 5 years clean. Pretty much sober the past 3 years with the exception of a very occasional drink. Work a full time job. Go to therapy. My life is stable, I have a lot of coping skills, and I value all of this."
How to stop anger burst when I’m manic or in a mixed episode?,"I’m in the process of getting a new psychiatrist or doctor who can help with my bipolar, and I’ve been raw dogging it for at least a month now.

"""real trauma""","I was hanging out with a couple of friends yesterday when we jokingly started going around and asking, ""between the two of us, which one of us is the least mature?"""
Just diagnosed yesterday,I’m so mad at myself even though I strongly suspected for the last week that I am bipolar. Before this I was literally ignorant or in denial my entire life. I only started to suspect it after I was about to destroy my marriage for the third time in 13 months. I was told I had depression and anxiety as a child and teenager and believed it. I am upset that every time I couldn’t last at a job I could never figure out why and just blamed myself and for myself real down over it.  I just started on seroquel last night and I know I’m impatient but i don’t know if I can make it a few weeks more I don’t have a big support system and I’m a sahm to 3 kids. I apologize if I don’t make sense I have had the hardest time especially in the last week stringing a sentence together.
How to function?,
Am I having derealization or getting into psychosis?,Hey y'all
First episode of mania,"I am 31M, in May 2022 i was prescribed zoloft 50mg by my doctor, it helped me a lot with my daily life, also helped me to get out of a long toxic relation that i was stuck in for years. Things remained perfectly fine for months. Then came december 2022, i was having some problems like low energy, not wanting to go to work, i talked to my doctor and he asked me to raise the dosage to 200 mg. Which i did. In a few days i was back on my routine, working, having fun with my friends, started partying a lot was drinking and getting high often. One day my brother and few cousins confronted me that i might be becoming bipolar, i was totally ignorant to that, another day went by, i had a massive fight with everyone at my home and left the house. Next night i took some mdma which totally went negative and i did a lot of stupid shit. Didn’t harm myself or anyone. My 2 friends were there who handled everything till i calmed down. Now i knew i fucked up and wanted to fix things in any way possible. A cousin was there who went to my home and told everything to my family, who got me thrown in a rehab. I was picked while i was asleep from my apartment and thrown there, i belong to pakistan and the rehab experience was very miserable it was like being in a prison. I was kept there for 2 months on God knows what medication. Their diagnosis was “drug induced mania”. They didn’t even diagnose me with bipolar or anything else as this was the only isolated incidence i had. Came back home, my family doesn’t want to talk about any of it. I didn’t go for any follow ups or take the medicine that they recommended. I wanted to get through all this myself. But its been 3 months now that i am out of the rehab, i am trying to be strong but i know i am super depressed. My legs keep shaking when i am sitting, i cannot find peace. What should i do? Should i go to a psychologist or psychiatrist? A part of me is afraid of taking any medication again! I am not the same person anymore, i used to be very confident, used to take risks in business, i was hard working. Now i just don’t trust my decisions. My morale is badly hurt. I don’t know what to do!"
Had to take Clonazepam to sleep because I was wide awake,"That sucked, especially because I like my routine. Not even the quetiapine could make me go to sleep so 2mg clonazepam down the hatch. I have cyclothymia and have been having high mood days but after last night I think the depression is coming back yayyyyy"
The most productive way to spend hypomania episodes?,"I have bipolar symptoms due to other condition, my hypomanic episodes are quite predictable. What are some productive ways you spend that time, accident it on purpose?"
Med change has got me nervous,"Decided on a big med change today with my psychiatrist. We’ve spent months trying to find an antipsychotic to add to my mood stabiliser (tegretol) that curbs my depression and we are just not winning at all. The decision was made to switch the tegretol out for lithium so as of tonight there is no tegretol and no antipsychotic, just lithium."
How many hours straight have you stayed up when hypomanic/manic?,"To preface, I am taking all my usual meds. Been in hypomania for a good week or so, maybe 2. Most recently, my sleep has completely disappeared. I was up for 40 hours, then my psychiatrist gave me a pill to knock me out for a good 8 hours, but it gave me horrible anxiety afterward, then I've been up for 36 hours since then. I'm worried I'll just keep going indefinitely. I'm not tired, not feeling any fatigue, just restless and energized. How long have you guys stayed awake with no sleep at all? What side effects have happened to you as a result? Is there anything I can do to force sleep? I'm scared."
Outpatient Program,"Hello everyone, I have been going through it quiet literally for the last several months. Well several years now, but most recently the last few months have been the hardest in awhile."
Anyone done TMS?,Anybody have any experience doing TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation).  It’s supposed to have a high success rate but I’d like to hear from actual patients if possible.  I’ve been in a treatment resisted depression since the holidays and I’m ready to try anything (almost).
Seroquel and losing my day,"Hey everyone so I've been on Quetiapine for 8+ weeks now and for the last two weeks I've been excessively sleeping through the day. I take 50mg in the morning and 50mg at night, as I find it hard to get through the day with just the one intake- I've been left without instructions or care advice but I believe this is for helping managing my psychotic symptoms and general anxiety+ mania, which is working I haven't had any hallucinations or hyper activity while on it, but I've been getting really depressed lately from missing the early hours of the day (I've been waking up at 7pm and falling asleep at 5am the following morning)"
Feel like body is in fight or flight response 24/7,"Does anybody feel this way? It’s almost like everything is heightened and I’m extremely stressed out all the time. My stomach always hurts and I’m always SUPER anxious. I feel like my body is barely relaxed, it’s always tense. Situations that wouldn’t normally make me anxious are now making me overly anxious. Also I’ve become very forgetful of things. I’m always misplacing my wallet or keys…or just anything for that matter. I think back to the days when my brain wasn’t all over the place, and it was somewhat quiet in my head. I have a hard time just staying on task reading a book, or even just getting up to go to work. Idk how I’ve made it a year at my job to be honest."
Medical leave from work and feeling guilty,"I’ve been in my worst depressive episode yet for like 2 weeks now. It’s some sort of miracle that I didn’t no-call/no-show at work last week. I talked to my psych yesterday and she told me to take a 10-day medical leave from work and prescribed seroquel. I’m on day 1 of that leave and already feel so guilty. Why do I get special treatment? Just because I’m lazy?  Just because I was able to convince a doctor that I’m a sad sack of shit? Everyone else can do their job just fine, why can’t I?"
Bipolar disorder and ADHD?,Hi all! I was diagnosed with Bipolar I over 10 years ago and have been relatively stable. I realized that I’ve always had concentration problems similar to ADHD. My doc had me try meds that did help but almost triggering a manic episode. Does anyone have any experience with a bipolar and adhd diagnoses?
Losing my touch with normality,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar as well as ADD and anxiety a couple of years ago (2019). Every single year since then I feel as though I have lost my touch with reality a little bit more. On a daily basis it feels more and more difficult to act like a human being around other people. If I continue to progress the way I am now, I'll be a complete hermit by the time i'm 30. On lithium, off lithium, on ritalin, and off. The only constant in my life since my diagnosis has been constant and debilitating suffering. While I do enjoy that 5-10% when i'm allowed to be anything more than content, it's a little egregious trying to deal with the other 90%. My whole life ive always been regarded as quiet or gentle. This has never bothered me. The real problem is the fact that more and more people I interact with seem to pick up the fact that there's SOMETHING wrong with me, even if they can't pinpoint what it is. It's like typical people have a sensor that goes off when they are in the presence of someone who doesn't fit in 100%. I don't have any real desire to be wanted or accepted by other people even, I just want them to understand me in a way that doesn't come off as unusual. I've tried approaching it logically, trying to really invest myself in my hobbies and interests, but of course those never take for more than a month or two. The only time I ever had a long sustained interest was when I was full of ritalin and fixated on weird arcane shit during the pandemic. No one wants to talk about that though. When I try to talk to people in social situations, I recieve blank stares as though I just said something obscene. What comment about the weather could I have made that confused or upset them so much? IDK maybe im just paranoid and nothings wrong with me HAHA. I don't even remember what I was upset about when I started ranting."
How do you cope with being stuck in a psych ward?,
The guilt of my past behaviour is eating me alive.,My ex and I were together almost 4 years.
Other things that happen during manic/hypomanic episodes and how to cope with them,"So, forgive me if this isnt the right place or isnt allowed to me postedd, i have read the rules tthe best of my abillities."
Bipolar + psychosis?,"Hey, does anyone happen to deal with psychotic symptoms/psychosis due to their bipolar disorder??"
can we really have a healthy relationship?,
Bipolar and PTSD = awful awful dissociation?,My psych seems to think my ptsd is giving me the extreme dissociation I’ve been feeling. I’m just confused because I guess to me I didn’t feel “triggered”. I just started feeling so out of it that I cant focus and everything is fading out of my mind and I’m anxious and I’m getting derealization. I guess I don’t know how ptsd works? I’m not saying she’s wrong but can someone explain this? How does PTSD and bipolar work together? I’m currently depressed as well.
Minor (individual) difficulties,"Ive had no episodes or major issues stem from my bipolar disorder for about the last 6 years, but i do experience the odd depressive day. Whenever I think about if I haven’t been depressed, its hard for me to actually tell if i haven’t been depressed, or if I’ve just been faking a smile and happiness."
I can't feel better sober,
Made it to work!,Been feeling like shit due to health issues.  But I got out of bed and made it to my job.  Consider this a big win.  Sometimes this illness is a lot.
Reminder: Avoid the dentist’s look of death,"So, I brush and use mouthwash once a day. Flossing, ummmm, rarely. But for someone with bipolar who struggles massively with that type of stuff, I feel like I do ok! Cue going to the dentist yesterday for a cleaning and checkup after a year. I kid you not:"
Multiple mood shifts??,"Hello everyone, A few weeks ago I had an episode but I'm confused as hell. I felt kinda hypomanic but my moods were shifting constantly. Laughing then sobbing then deadpan neutral. I've never experienced that many mood shifts in a day. It was like flipping a switch and my mood changed. Have you experienced something like this?"
I’m at my breaking point and I drew what it feels like,
Struggling with motivation to stay on medication.,"I am newly diagnosed Bipolar 2, just about 6 months ago."
So hurt and upset about being the “crazy ex gf”,
Psychiatrist want me to transition over to just seeing a primary care physician,"Because I have been managing my bipolar for many years and only see a psychiatrist every 3 to 6 months for check in, my psychiatrist asked if I wanted to transition to just seeing a PCP. I think this is a terrible idea. PCP's are not trained in psychiatry and what happens if I have an episode and is hospitalized? I told her no. Is this a weird request?"
I’m not sure if I’m going into Mania or at having an epiphany,"To give a little context I’ve been sober for 24 days, the longest I’ve been sober in well over 7 years, and I’ve been on what has been the most steady meds I’ve ever been on since being re-diagnosed from Bipolar 2 to 1."
What might this be?,"I am not asking for a diagnosis (I have BP 1), but am just wondering if this could be mania/psychosis/nothing? Symptoms: dissociation/getting lost easily, paranoia, hallucinations that aren't full on (side view or behind me), thinking things are signs for me, feeling like someone is out to get me, random anger, no appetite, wanting to run away because you want to be free from those following you, and an intense fear at all times (feels like HIGH anxiety). I'm not elevated in mood. Any advice or tips on what this is and how to deal with it is appreciated!"
I don't know how to keep going. I really don't.,"I'm broken. I don't even know if my bipolar diagnosis right, at this point I'm thinking it may be BPD instead/in addition because I feel like a  different person every goddamn day for the last few weeks."
Rapid cycling is destroying me,
"CHECK-IN WEDNESDAY ✅- June 14, 2023",How are you feeling so far this week? Let us know how you're doing.
Finally looking up,"After two weeks of what felt like a gruelling two months of depression, it seems like it’s finally getting a bit better. Now, this could be one of three things. Either;"
"So, I’m pretty sure this is an ADHD thing, but maybe a bipolar thing? I know there are more than a few ADHD here so, if you can, please tell me what this is and what to do/how to cope?","What is it called when you have plenty of time to do things but your brain says no, do nothing because there isn’t any time? Like.. I usually eat dinner around 5:30-6. I take my night meds and starting winding down around 8-9. That’s at least 2 hours where I could do… something. But my brain says “nah, it’s almost time to go to bed so it’s no point in getting involved”. Doesn’t matter what I’m thinking of doing. After dinner has become a dead time for me because I just can’t do things. I will say, if I do something quick for food, like drink a shake or throw together a sandwich, I can keep working after dinner. But if I have to stop and cook or go out.. that is the end of my day. I’ve actually started associating the ability to function after dinner with being hypomanic.. cause productivity. And obviously, this is all worse when I’m depressed… what is food? I do none of the things when I’m down."
New Job,i’ve just accepted a new job and im scared im going to become manic and quit or screw things up. i’ve done it with all of my past jobs- but i want this one to work out. what should i do?

question on violent intrusive thoughts,"Hey guys, I've recently been diagnosed with bipolar and I've been on lamotrigine for around two months or so now. I've been having flashes of violent scenarios these past few days and I would like to understand it a bit better. Does anyone have any experience that can help?"
I made it,"Just got the closest to saying goodbye these last few weeks, as ever. Today, ladies, gents, and everyone in between, I think it’s done!!! I’d like to thank Twenty One Pilots with all my heart. The flip switched today; I’ll see ya next time around, bitch 💕"
The thin line of sanity is probably just hypomania,
How long did it took for you to have some positive effects from lamotrigine,Hi! I know this is differs from one person to another but i have to ask
Adhd med experiences,Hey I understand this is a pretty subjective topic as everyone reacts differently to meds but I was wondering what everyone’s experiences with different adhd meds where in regards to triggering mania as I have hyperactive adhd and have been on Ritalin and concerta since I was around 12 and never had any issues with it triggering a manic episode however I have heard that Ritalin is generally safer than other stimulants for people with bipolar so I was wondering what everyone else’s experiences have been especially as I have been thinking about changing meds to see if I can better manage my symptoms without the crazy high dose I’m on atm
Life with no instructions manual,"I (24F) hace been struggling with my mental health since I was a teenager. Officially have been diagnosed with bpd and ciclothymia, but personally thinking there’s more there… I feel like everyone came to life with an instructions manual on 'how to live' and I didn't. Everything I do or have to do, from relationships, to basic hygiene, to emotions, to work, to hobbies to everything, makes me feel like a failure and that I'm just a terrible human. It also doesn't help that I'm unemployed rn and struggling with my physical health. I be having a good couple days and suddenly everything is terrible. I start hating everyone, I star feeling deeply lonely and sad, I want to cry, everything my mom says annoys me, I don't want to do anything, any option makes me sick, any tv show, any activity feels disgusting, any ideas I get from google or YouTube seem like bs. I start questioning if I even love my boyfriend, if he's even worth my time, if I even like him. Generally a feeling of life being too overwhelming (even if mine is privileged compared to others) and that participating in it is too much work and thinking that nothing is even worth it (not related to wanting to cs, if you can understand..). I am and have been in therapy over the years. Somehow I always end up in the same existential crisis mindset, feeling that I'll never change and that I'm truly not a good human being. Does this experience resonate with anyone? At this point I think reading other people's stories is the only thing that brings me some grounding."
I’m worried if my awakening is the start of hypomania?,I’m worried if my awakening is the start of hypomania?
Am I experiencing mania? TW: SA,
Zombie Apocalypse,
"Terrified all the time, don’t know what’s going on. Seeing “flashes” of things too.","For the past couple of weeks (3-4) I’ve been experiencing increasing anxiety and nervousness, like I just feel like something bad is going to happen all the time. My stomach hurts, my heart will feel nervous, I’m tense. Sometimes I cry because I’m so nervous. But I’m not depressed, I’m just very anxious and can’t relax."
I converted to a religion two years ago and I wonder if I was hypomanic during the whole process,"I became interested in a religion four years ago after working at a school associated with that religion. This started in 2019. I started learning more about the religion and studying up on it from 2019 to 2021. I officially converted to said religion in 2021. Since 2022, I have completely lost interest in celebrating the holidays, going to services, and being associated with that religion. I think during the time I first became interested I was looking for a new identity and I was probably hypomanic. I sincerely don’t care for the religion anymore and can’t even believe I converted to it. Has anyone else ever done anything like this?"
Finally,"I’m finally in a good point in my life. Work keeps me busy, I’ve been working out with my girlfriend, my last episode brought us closer since she was directly impacted by it. I just feel really good about life. I’ve stopped taking my seroquel for not but I’m still taking my Prozac and lamictal. I don’t want to anticipate another episode so we will keep things positive for now."
Mania and tattoo,"Hey reddit, so currently I'm in manic or hypomanic (idk which one) and I'm being impulsive getting a tattoo. The problem is now I really like the tattoos I have and I want more tattoos. What should I do? I'm worried that this is just a state and I will hate myself for getting these tattoos. Also my mom doesn't agree with me having tattoo."
I thought I was getting better,"So I’ve been diagnosed bipolar ll for abt 3 years now and I just recently (3 months) started taking my prescribed meds ( 150 mg lemotragine and 40mg prozac) daily and aiming for the same time everyday. I’ve been really good abt taking them as i haven’t been for the last 2 years ish lol my best friend of abt a year and a half and i had a little scuffle and she told me ‘if this happens again and i snap at you, i won’t come back this time’ i basically made a joke that i guess i went to far and she got rly mad blah blah blah. i was v drunk when this happened too. i had some super close friends who up and left suddenly after 2 years and it seriously hurt me and she knows abt it. after this whole situation i feels like i just sank. like deep deep depression. i haven’t felt suicidal in a really really long time and now all of a sudden i am. i wasn’t even aware i was manic, i thought i was just regulated but my bf said ‘well u were a bit manic so it’s probably just a depressive episode coming on’. i’ve been trying to manage it and do self care and focus on school and work but i feel myself isolating and mustering up old relationship insecurities and at this point idk what to do. all i can think abt is doing any drug i can think of but i genuinely don’t wanna go back to abusing substances. any recommendations? anyone else get like this? anyone else get super affected by friendships? thanks in advance. just rly lost rn"
May be in a mixed episode,"I just feel like I've become so lost to life, as it's been a thing happening to me as I cling to the thread that guides me along the years. I've been on lithium since December and it's worked up until a month or two ago. It's made me gain 60 lbs since then and I gave into it and ate whatever and didn't exercise much. I've also had two instances where I went on 5 dates and then the person ghosted me. I'm quitting teaching and havnt done a new job yet and only have two weeks left of the school year then I'm unemployed. I find out if I got a job I interviewed for tomorrow. Idk what I'm going to do if I don't get it. I had a psych appointment today and they're going to start me on a weight loss med. I've decided just to revert and lose weight like I did a few years back and be anorexic again even though it took along time to recover. My blood pressure was insane and I'm the heaviest I've ever been. I just want solace. I've just been wishing to be dead or get cancer. I just feel like I'm wasting my life and that losing this weight will make me happy like it did before and I had confidence. I just hate myself. Sorry if this post seems pedantic and frantic. my mind is scrambling. I just feel like a shell of my former self."
Being bipolar with extensive brain injuries,"Hello - I have been thinking a lot about this recently and wanted to see if anyone has any insight on what it’s like to be bipolar and also have had multiple head traumas. I have had 3 Major & 4 Minor concussions in my life, ranging from ages 11 - 21. (my current age) I personally feel as if it makes it harder to manage my bipolar symptoms with each head trauma. After my first three concussions, I was actually still able to be a very productive member of society. I was able to hold a job, manage my relationships, control all my manic episodes and coast pretty well through the depressive ones. However, following each of the two concussions i’ve had in the last 2 years. I have found that my symptoms seem less manageable, if not even worsened as a whole. It is not like they have been changing my meds a lot, I have been on the same dosages since January, but following my concussion in April, everything has seemed so much harder. I ended up losing my job due to taking a few days to heal from the concussion and since then have not been able to hold a job down. I was admitted to the psych ward for the first time a month ago. Finding it hard to even find the motivation to get another job at this point, as I feel I won’t be able to keep up with it."
Just looking for a few kind internet strangersi,I feel at a dead end. In the past year my marriage has been rocky. We've gotten much better but not where we'd like to be. I got genetic testing done to find meds that would work with my body. And they seemd too. Now I'm not sure. I feel in a constant state of edge. I'm always afraid my husband is going to leave me. When nothing shows that he will. Little shit always has me crying or overthinking. I'm constantly feeling like a failure to my loved ones. I feel like a massive burden. Even lately after having an orgasm my body shakes pretty bad and I cry. Yes I've been smoking stuff. And for the most part it helps. I feel like my friends and family are sick of giving me advice. I feel like I never move past my issues. I just want one day to not have my brain attack me. To not feel so wrapped up in my thoughts and anxiety. I want my husband to come home happy to see me. Idk where I'm going with this or if it's a plea or just my mind needing to let it all out. I tried therapy over time and never feel like I've resolved everything. I usually walk out feeling more confused and anxious and unresolved. I've lost 2 loved ones this year. I'm afraid to lose anyone else. I've not gotten great sleep. I eat like shit. I'm trying to change. I don't want to be anyone's burden. Sorry for such a long post. Thank you for reading.
Feeling like being under an emotional microscope,"I wanted to know if any one else feels like they are under an emotional microscope. I tend to feel like everyone can recognize my emotions and they think I’m crazy. My emotions may not have anything to do with being bipolar, nor are they out of proportion whatsoever, but I still feel judgement. They are also usually not noticeable by others unless I say something about it. There is no reason for me to believe, for the most point, people think I’m crazy. I still feel like I have to keep telling myself I’m not. When I’m in a depressive episode I feel constantly watched when I’m around others and they are plotting against me trying to make me unstable. When I’m manic, I withdraw from others too. I’m so worried that people will think I’m unreliable or not trustworthy. When I’ve had conflicts with roommates that had nothing to do with my illness, I was dismissed and nobody took responsibility for actions that were unprovoked and clearly disrespectful. They dismissed it and said I was bipolar. It’s not like I yelled at them or brought it up inappropriately. I have months of stability at least every year, but due o past experiences, I’m still worried all people think of me is crazy."
Brain Fog Tips?,I'm surprised my psychiatrist didn't prescribe anything last month for my brain fog. I think it's because I was going to be tested for ADHD. Maybe it would've skewed the results?
Psychiatrist says I’m improving,I just needed to share this with people who understand. I’ve been seeing my new psychiatrist for the last year and I love her. For the first time ever I’m actually on the right meds and I’m improving. My husband told me he sees such a difference now. It’s nice to finally start getting my life back to “normal”.
going to work during a low,hi guys. basically i was stable for a couple weeks and everything was fine. but the past two days i haven’t been able to leave the house and had to call out of work. are there any ways that you found that keep you going to work when a low is coming on?
I learned that I'm not stupid and weak; I'm just bipolar with other mental issues,"Hi there, I recently came in terms with my bipolar disorder. Just want to express myself here, because the feeling of loneliess and hopelessness I'm experiencing, because there is no one around me in my life who really understands."
I want to become a psychiatrist and my family is discouraging me due to my bipolar diagnosis.,"I’ve been stable for 1 year and I will wait two more before deciding to go back to school. If I have another episode, I’ll pick a different career path. But I’m properly medicated and recovering from a manic episode/psychosis. I’ve had three episodes and I think they’re still fresh on everyone’s mind. Are there any successful professionals out there who can attest to the value of pursuing one’s goals despite having bipolar disorder?"
Crave being in nature when manic,Anyone else just wanna be outside when they’re manic lol. I’m not a nature person at all but lately just been loving chilling outside. Been wanting to go on a hike and stuff lol.
23M my sex drive is way too high,I was diagnosed with bi polar at 16 and I believe it is the cause of my high sex drive. I can't stop messing around with girls and guys and it just keeps getting stronger and I'm getting looser is there any way to manage or simmer down the sex drive?
trying to leave Service Industry after 15 years,"I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 28. I'm now 34 and have been working in either food service or social work case aid situations since I was 16. I've been working exclusively food service for the past 10 years. I can't continue working and trying to juggle my mental health in such a demanding, fast paced and catty environment. I even love the owners of where I work now but dealing with my snotty manager and a sea of customers all day has me in a scary burn out where I'm afraid I'll snap at my manager and lose my job."
Question for those with ADHD AND Bipolar TWs,TW: IDEATION
PSYCHIATRIST says I’m no longer bipolar because of management,"Has anyone else experienced this? My old psychiatrist started acting like I didn’t have bipolar I because all the pills and severe lifestyle changes helped even my moods and shorten my psychotic episodes and started referring to me as having moderate depression. Why? Because my mood seemed typically low when she saw me once every four months for a single year, I wasn’t ranting and raving like a lunatic in her office and I hadn’t been hospitalized between appointments (-:"
loosing my fucking grip,
Coping with excessive spending,How do you all cope with the excessive spending part of mania? I have realized in the last week I’ve spent $200. I want to find a way to barr myself from doing this in the future. Luckily I’m able to watch it early on in this episode. This is the first episode I’ve had where excess spending is an issue
On lamotrigine and cariprazine for 2 months now but the anhedonia persists.Any pointers to get out of it?,I was diagnosed with bi polar 1 disorder and was prescribed the above medications for the last two months but everything still seems so boring and feel like jumping from one activity to another to get some sort of stimuli.Everything seems so dull.Anyone out there with similar experience?
Tips for driving as bipolar,"Hi, I'm resuming learning how to drive a car after 8 years of pause. It's the first time I'm at the wheel since my diagnosis.I suffer from attention deficit mostly during hypomania. (Although the psychiatrist recognised my attention deficit symptoms, I don't fit the bill for ADHD so I'm not diagnosed with it.)"
Off my meds for two days and I feel TERRIBLE,"I take Latuda and Cymbalta as my main psych meds, plus gabapentin for chronic pain and Zofran for the nausea the Latuda causes. For the last five years I've taken my medications right before bed. I struggled a lot with going on and off meds when I was in my early twenties, and a ""keep it simple, stupid"" approach to taking meds at the same time every day has helped me stay consistent. It's been the stablest, in many ways the best, period of my life; I owe my life to these medications."
Insurance won't refill Latuda all of a sudden and I'm totally out,"I'm on 60mg latuda, insurance suddenly says they won't cover it anymore, both the brand name and the generic Lurasidone. I've tried Goodrx and its still $1337 per refill. Which is not possible for me. My psych tried some stuff with them but its still not working. I took my last dose two nights ago and I'm worried I'm going to be effected soon. My sleep already suffered because it helps put me to sleep. If that goes, I usually go manic pretty soon. My anxietys been bad, but whether thats from withdrawal or just going thru the actual ordeal idk. I was told to contact a health advocate, because I do have good insurance and they said that person might be able to help, but I havent heard back from them yet."
Workout Tips,"Hey there yall! I've been doing pretty good recently, been real consistent with my meds (finally) and wanted to see about maybe going to a gym!"
I'm scared of having another psychotic episode,It happened like a year ago and so far I've been stable. I'm on abilify and lamotrigine. For some reason I'm scared of having another episode. What is the likelihood it will happen if I'm medicated? Do I need to be on antipsychotics forever?
The forest is therapy,I just got back from the COOLEST music festival ever. A friend invited me out and it was awesome. I spent 6 days by a river and slept in a hammock. Gorgeous sunrises over the river with campfire coffee is something everyone needs to experience. We had the entire campground to ourselves because we were early and even ran the light shows for bands. 🤘It’s exactly what I needed to really get in a good groove to get some stuff done. I feel way better and I’m ready to start treatment.
I didn’t get the job I desperately wanted and I’m crushed,I’m already so depressed and wanted to get away from my current job and town and everything for a long time now…. I know I shouldn’t lose hope over one job but it’s really hard to stay positive after being denied job after job after job. I am so despondent. I feel so stuck in my circumstances I just want to cry. I hate every day of my life. I need out.

unhappy mania?,hi everyone. i’m pretty new to my diagnosis and i have a question. i’m exhibiting many symptoms of mania but am still incredibly unhappy. is this normal? is this something else entirely? is it possible to be manic whilst depressed even slightly? i’m really sorry if this comes across as incorrect but i’m really struggling at the moment and need someone to reassure me. thank you all :)
Is this summer mania?,"I was diagnosed bipolar 2 recently. I've been extremely depressed with psychotic symptoms through winter,  now I'm cycling between what I think is mania and depression throughout the day depending on weather."
I can't feel anything anymore??,"I've always felt insane, my emotions have always been so intense it was like being dragged down into water. I don't feel much anymore. I think I ruined my life. I don't know if I even feel love for the person who's been with me for over a year. He asked me why I've continued to tell him I love him, I said its because I want to, and I did. He asked me if I was just pretending, I don't have the answers to anything. Without him I don't have a place to live that I can afford on my own. I may have to drop out right before starting college. I don't feel anything about it really. I've been on medication, just antipsychotics, I haven't taken them in I think about two days which usually would mean I'd be a wreck. I don't think I'm a great person, and I don't know if I love the only person who may ever love me anymore. I honestly don't want to hurt him, I do care. But I can't really feel much now. I don't know what happened to me."
Been expirementing with colors,
My birthday is so triggering,"Every year my birthday makes me so depressed and angry. I’m not sad about getting older, I really don’t know why it makes feel so angry and sad. I’m just thankful that this year I’ve been able to control it a bit. I’ve bitten my tongue when I’ve wanted to verbally lash out.  Maybe I just can’t handle being the center of attention? I cry I rage, then I shut down/dissociate for awhile and return to ‘normal’."
Quietapine sporadic use,"Hi, I have Bipolar 2 and after letting my doctor know I have been feeling (not hypomanic but) a little more up than usual he prescribed me with quietapine for the first time. He didn’t tell me to take a steady dose every day but only take a tablet when I couldn’t calm down or couldn’t sleep."
My meds are working really well.,"Last September I was diagnosed at the age of 25 with Bipolar 1. I was soon put on medication which I have been on for a total of nine months now. I haven’t had a manic episode or even hypomania in a while, I can’t even really remember the last time I had a depressive episode. It’s starting to trip me out though because now it feels like I’ve been faking this disorder the whole time. But then again, I have to remind myself that my meds are working and that’s why I haven’t had any episodes. Does that make sense?"
Can you feel anxiety on hypomania?,"A few month ago I was diagnosed as bipolar 2, so I start taking medication to degrease the level of depression and delay episodes. Last days I feel wierd, there are some Symptoms of hypomania, like racing thoughts, distracting, spending money. But I dont feel confidence and happy like always. Also my sleep is normal (except this weekеnd, when I drunk with friend and didnt sleep for 40 hours). Also I feel anxiety. So I cant understand is it a hypomania Episode or I my Imagination is overreacting. Maybe someone experienced something like that? (sorry for my grammar and mistakes, I dont very well in it)"
i did good today.,"i woke up tangled in the sheets next to my love. i took my medicine, though with a watered down diet coke from the previous night, i took them. i tidied up my bed. i didn’t make it, but i fixed it up. i brushed my teeth and my hair. looked at myself in the mirror as i did. i wasn’t as mean this time. i was indifferent instead. i stretched and cracked my back. i washed my face, moisturized even. i have yet to shower, yet to clean the house, and yet to change out of my pjs. but, i did good today."
I drew for the first time in 3 years!,"The last 3 years have been a lot for me mentally. I finished grad school, passed my board exams, had a baby, and started a new job straight out of maternity leave. I felt like I had lost all creativity and the ability to focus on anything that used to be mine. It was all about my son, my family, my job and just trying to hide the constant mixed/manic episodes. My husband would tell me that me that I’d feel so much better and less stressed if I went back to this hobby or he pleaded “any hobby”. He didn’t quite understand that every attempt I made to draw, paint, write, or anything creative was completely washed out of me because I was in constant survival mode masking my intense episodes so I could function for my family. It’s laughable to even say that, because to the outside world it might have looked like I was a very ambitious, driven and extremely productive person…those who knew me personally could see how bad the spiral was and they tried the best they could. I finally switched psychiatrists, after working together 10 years and although scary, it was the best move for me. I took a job that is structured, very positive culture, and honestly does stand by work/life balance. There’s no expectation to work outside of my contract hours plus my boss and coworkers are amazing. I found a female psychiatrist who was able to invest the time for hour long sessions rather than 15 minute med check-ins. She also has given me the acceptance and understanding that child birth really screws up a lot of us birthing people who are bipolar. I’ve always been bipolar 1 and I’ve had mixed episodes in the past. But as I was explaining to my new doctor, this has been the first time in since my son was born in which I have gone from severe ups to severe manic mixed episodes with only very brief periods of stability or depression."
I am so broken,"Three weeks ago today, the love of my life ended things with me. This isn’t the first time either. In fact, it’s the third time. He says he’s too fucked up and unsure of himself to be in a relationship. He has good reasons which I don’t want to get into, but he also has promised me the world and told me over and over how he didn’t want to lose me for the past year."
Cheated during a bout of serious mania. Looking for words of encouragement/advice/comments or anything.,"Hopefully everyone can hear me out before rushing to judgment. I’m severely bipolar and have been dealing with the disorder since 2010. My wife and I have been together since 2013 and married since Oct. of 2018. Before we started dating I told her about my illness and all of the symptoms that come with it, including mania and psychosis. I tend to become manic during the holidays and start to recover in this spring. This season was the worst bout of mania I’ve ever experienced. A friend of mine lives in New York and invited me up for his birthday celebration. Drinking, drugs and situations of excitement severely impact mania. My wife and I have a 14 month old, our first child together. Getting out of the house for a night in the city was incredibly exciting. The first sign of real mania was me putting my card down for a $1,400 dinner tab. The second was binge drinking. The third was buying a VIP section in the club we went to, another $5,000. I live a comfortable life but in no way do I have any business spending that much money. The last sign was when I started to take drugs. Cocaine and Molly. Things I haven’t touched for a decade. By this time I was in complete psychosis. At some point I disappeared from the group and received oral sex from someone in the club. I don’t know the person and can hardly remember it. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been to multiple doctors to ensure I am clean after multiple tests for STDs. The only thing that holds me back from having peace of mind is the possibility of having HPV. It’s been since January 14th and I’ve been stuck. Do I tell her and risk ruining our marriage, her ability to trust me and probably anyone else, or risk breaking up our family and seeing my son grow up with a split household? We haven’t had sex since January 14th and I’m afraid I’ll never be able to touch her again. I know it’s wrong and no matter how bad I want to I can’t bring myself to do it. She is finally starting to ask why I haven’t touched her and I lied and told her it was my meds. Is this a dark secret I keep? Do I tell her? I have to think of my family. This isn’t just a post to tell me it is ok what I did. I feel shame, worthless and like I don’t deserve them. But I feel like they need me. And I certainly need them."
First IV Ketamine Treatment,"For Context: I have been diagnosed with PTSD and BP-1 Disorder. I normally do sublingual tablets under the tongue for my ketamine treatments (prescription) that I do at my house. But as the anniversary of the PTSD-related trauma is happening this week, he referred me to do an IV ketamine infusion instead. I've also done nebulizer treatments with him."
Wanting to be that person I was when I was hypomanic,"When I didn't know I was bipolar, I just thought I was ADHD, I started taking Vyvanse for ADHD and experienced a fundamental and radical change in who I was as a person. Like every self doubt I ever had washed away, I had an amazing elevated mood, I could focus very well because I was doing a lot of mindfulness, and I had amazing goal directed behavior. I didn't know that I was hypomanic at the time, and I just thought the Vyvanse had fundamentally changed who I was for the better. My identity fundamentally changed from this experience, and ever since then I find myself with ocd like compulsions to be that person again. Its like my identity/personality is wrapped up in who I was during that episode, but who I actually am can't fulfill that identity. I am having a hard time moving past this, even though my mood is now normal. My anxiety around this has improved a lot with CBT, and mindfulness. I'm ramping up on lamictal, and that helps somewhat as well. Any advice would be appreciated, and thank you very much."
I almost ruined my life yesterday,Long story short I decided in a manic episode that I was going to break my apartment lease. I convinced myself I was going to take out a loan and pay off the remainder of it because I got in my head that I needed to move to be happy.
Feeling doomed to failure,"Anyone else ever feeled doomed? Like no matter what you do, you manage to mess up every relationship you've ever had or will have? Like people will think you're OK until they get to know you and then realize how broken you are? I take my meds, go to therapy, and desperately try to not mess up. But within the past week, I've been told by one person (date) that I went overboard on the emotions after only 2 dates and another new friend that, when trying not to hurt their feelings, I instead came across as rude, condescending, arrogant, entitled, etc. I feel like I just keep getting kicked while I'm down."
Helpless Romantic,"I’m hoping I can get some good memes or encouraging words. I feel so anxious about a lot of things, not the least of which is never having had a long term relationship. I’m trying to figure out when I will be ready. It’s tough cause what I want to focus on is just becoming more stable. Stability seems to constantly elude me. I wish I knew why this desire to love someone on that level keeps coming into my head :P"
i feel so broken.,"i was literally just laying in bed, on my phone and started crying. just sobbing. what the fuck did i do during my manic episode. i lost my partner, the only partner who has never fucking abused me, and they treated me amazingly. i blew up at one of my friends for no reason. i spent all my money yesterday. i DRANK and im underage. i told my ed therapist i was doing so much better and she was so proud. and now here i am. my mood fucking switched in a single second. why am i like this. why does this happen. fuck."
Is your brain this crazy? How to forgive and forget my past self,Hey
Pre-diagnosed and scared,"I (35f) had an appointment yesterday with a therapist who told me I might suffer from bipolar disorder. I have had a few depressive episodes for the past 10 years and since 2021 I have also experienced some symptoms that are consistent with the definition of mania. I have been on therapy regularly since 2020 and I have consulted a psychiatrist since 2021 who put me on quetiapine but while my therapist does not talk about a diagnose, the psychiatrist told me that these were mild mood changes and did not consist of bipolar. The meds are okay and help me sleep, but did not prevent me from having both manic and depressive symptoms. About 2 months ago i went to my general doctor because of a sinus infection and ended up crying in his office with a huge panick attack and opened up about how i was feeling mentally. He referred me to a therapist (both part of the national heath service - i am not in uk but in a country with a fairly good free and public health service). Yesterday i had my appointment and i mentioned a manic episode i had about 1 month ago - a burst of energy that lasted 5 days). My final diagnose will probably come only in august when i will have an appointment with NHS psychiatrist but the therapist suggested bipolar disorder and although i feel like my intuition and symptoms are being validated, i am also scared. I am on work leave due to feeling miserable and i am worried my condition worsens and gets me in trouble. I have a wonderful, caring and understanding partner who is taking the load of caring for our house and 3 kids almost exclusively. I know i will get better with meds (doctor had me on sertraline as well) but i am really scared of telling my parents and friends about this. I feel like a huge failure, not living up to my full potential and just a disorganized mess. What was it like for you folks with a late diagnose and what can i do - small stuff - to make this a little easier? Thank you all so much"
Fear of my reflection,"Sometimes when I'm manic I get really scared of my own reflection, like I'm fully convinced it's its own person and it's going to hurt me. Does anyone else experience this? Is it just me?"
Therapy,"Help, I have a therapy appointment tomorrow and I’m dreading it, I want to break up with my therapist but don’t want to seem crazy bitchy, she says really rude things and does not give me ways to cope. I’m struggling finding ways to look for another therapist. I also go to an all woman DBT group which I enjoy but one on one therapy i fucking hate. I’m still struggling to find the right meds as well. I started birth control and i feel insane. I think its fucking with my energy levels big time and i have horrendous effects."
"Those with BD2, do you have a fear of becoming BD1 someday?","I was diagnosed with BD2 last year and it took me six months to accept it. I am still to this day looking back on my behavior and realizing how it was me being hypomanic. I have recently developed a fear that I’ll progress to BD1 someday. I also have a fear I’ll have psychosis one day. I take my meds everyday, but that fear still persists. Can anyone relate?"
Bipolar meds working for other things 🤔,I was first diagnosed just with depression as a teen went thru the med rotation system for years some helped sort of but nothing ever seemed to fully help. Eventually in my late twenties I was diagnosed as bipolar type 2 and was on lithium for about a year maybe 2 and seemed to work great. Then I went unmedicated for a year after I moved hours away from my psych. Recently found a new one and first appointment she diagnosed as bipolar type one and put me in lamotragine I’ve titrated up to 150mg once a day with no plans of upping it. I started really feeling better/noticing a difference at the 100mg but still doing quite well at 150. My last appointment tho the psych suggested possibly borderline and/or PTSD. Ugh 😣 no med change for now but I don’t wanna keep on the marry go round of meds? Anyone have any multiple disorders that your meds for bipolar seem to actually help with?
I'm not as happy as my family may believe,
went back to the psych ward,2 times within almost 1 year. Nearly 2 weeks each. Everything feels like deja vu.
"Sometimes, I worry I’m misdiagnosed.","I’m diagnosed bipolar 2. I haven’t had any hypomania in a very long time. I did go through a period of two weeks this past fall where I didn’t sleep and felt wired, but that’s it. My hypomania symptoms seem so subtle when compared to the symptoms of others. Maybe I’m just properly treated? I don’t know. I feel very lost. I’m struggling a lot with anxiety right now, and I’m wondering if an SSRI would help. But I know those drugs can be bad for treatment of bipolar disorder and bring on mania. So, I don’t know. I’m working with my psychiatrist. I have even had a full psychiatric evaluation. I just don’t experience hypomania the way others do, and that makes me question my diagnosis. Anyone else ever feel this way?"
I think I'm doing therapy wrong,I learned all my coping skills and strategies outside of therapy.
Direction,"Sometimes it really feels no matter how much I might try life is just so mundane and repetitive. I know it’s part of the bill, but I still struggle to conform to social standards to this day. I feel empty inside, unfulfilled, unloved. I wish I could change so much of my past. I wouldn’t be lonely, I wouldn’t be full of regrets, alas I know this is never going to happen. I just have to find out who I am with time."
What happens during your episodes and what do you do?,"I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder (2015) and new to this sub. I want to know what exactly others are dealing with. What kind of thoughts do you get, how's your lifestyle, any details you can share would be helpful."
Mixed Episodes?,"hi y’all! i’ve been wondering what mixed episodes feel like if you have bipolar 2, i think i’ve experienced some before but am not sure because i haven’t really found anything that describes what they’re like. any personal experiences or advice would really help, so thank y’all who are willing to share :)"
I feel lonely,"I feel like I have no friends and no one like me. Recently I started a course hoping I'll make some friends there, and I did not. It will end soon. I don't know how to make friends"
artwork i made when i was 16/17. cant believe anyone doubted my diagnosis 😭,
Just one wreck to my life after another,Has anyone had to file for bankruptcy to deal with the large amounts of debt they accrued while manic?
"Everything was fine, until it wasn't again.",26 year old female and no matter what I do I feel this disorder is just progressing.
Accepting Diagnosis,"Hi everyone! I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar Type 2. This came as an absolute shock to me as I went in expecting an ADHD diagnosis. I know many symptoms are the same/similar. I can't help but somewhat refuse to believe it. (Not that it is bad, it was just a different one than I expected)"
Got dumped. Again.,"Fuck my life, fuck this disease fuck life fuck myself"
How do you cope with the let down from a manic episode? (Content warning: self destructive behavior),"I’m sorry I’m not super familiar with the rules here, so if you are sensitive to talk about self destructive behavior, I’d suggest not reading on!!!"
I feel like a car engine having trouble to start,"Like an older truck, you put the key in shift it and turn the shift. And then you hear it trying to start but stopping, It’s like I need fingers crossed that I’ll start because I stayed up all night and I slept only for 3 hours and I have work soon I’m surviving on monster energy drink and a banana. My shift is 5:30-8pm hopefully I’ll last."
I returned to smoking after two years because of mania.,"Long story short, I couldn't sleep the last couple of days. Two days ago I hadn't slept at all, yesterday I slept 3 hours at most, and something told me to go and buy a pack of cigarettes, I ended up buying a tobacco heater with a supply of refills. I don't know what I'm doing anymore."
How to have discipline,"For as long as I remember, I have had basically no discipline. I can tell myself that I will make a change and I can be good for maybe a month at max and then I fail. I can never tell myself no. NO MATTER WHAT."
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for Bipolar disorder?,Has anyone had ECT to treat their bipolar depression?
Was doing so good,"Had a few weeks there of feeling good and stable, but today I just feel so meh, like no one really cares so why should I? Feeling like no one reaches out, I have to do all the work, and I guess I'm kinda tired of trying. Social media is full of garbage and just brings me down so I don't look at it much anymore. Not feeling optimistic or excited about anything today. On 200mg lamotrigine and it's been wonderful. Even today isn't really THAT bad, but I just hate breaking the streak, ya know? Hoping it doesn't get any worse and goes away quickly."
Oversleeping when depressed,Do you sleep a lot when you’re depressed? Or am I the only one it happens to ? I’m thinking it’s probably my meds overworking? There’s past few days I’ve been so down with low energy. I don’t know what’s happening to me
struggling and made this,i finally got to paint for the first time in a while. it helps. i went to a zoom bipolar support group today and i had to leave after a while. i am so sick of being a severe case. comparing myself to other bipolar people makes it worse. i have never been able to function on less than three meds at once. i can't hold a job long term. i always thought the next pill would make me okay but i think this is as good as i'm going to get. working on accepting it.
Having a hard time telling between dreams and reality,"And I'm out of my AP because I lost my prescription and the pharmacy won't refill it until the 20th. My doc knows, my therapist knows. But I'm afraid it's just going to get worse. I have memories and can't tell if they're real or from dreams. It isn't really impacting my functioning but it's disconcerting as hell. Any advice on how to get through the next 8 days?"
Doctor thinks I'm bipolar this might be a long one,Hello beautiful people!
I try to paint every time the power goes out. Here's today's power-out painting.,
Moving Abroad and Medicine Availabillity,"Hi, all.  I have bipolar, and I'm taking Zoloft and Depakote, which work wonders for me.  In fact, I've gone through a ton of meds, and this combo is the only one that makes me feel okay.  I'm hoping to move abroad within the next few years, and I want to be sure I can have access to these medications.  I know the EU has some restrictions on Depakote for people of child-bearing age.  Are there any other countries I need to be wary of that won't be as easy to access my meds?  Or do any of you have experience with accessing medicine while moving abroad? Thank you, my friends :)"
“I think everyone has some bipolar in them”,Has anyone had someone say this to them? How did you feel? Apparently everyone is bipolar! Personally it really bothered me. It’s like….kinda crippling and I feel like the statement downplays what it’s really like.
How do you stay grounded during psychosis?,Tl;dr: what healthy coping mechanisms do you like to do to keep yourself grounded when you are feeling psychotic or in a highly manic state?
it’s not bad enough,"I feel like an idiot all the time because i see people going through so much worse than me yet they’re doing so much better. I can’t even make it to work most days it’s a miracle how i haven’t been fired meanwhile people will be at their lowest points and still work just fine. i’m sick of people telling me that i shouldn’t compare but that doesn’t matter when the general public sees you as dysfunctional. a year ago i loved work i never missed a day and then i got diabetes and rapid switching bp2 ontop of everything else. it feels like nothing i’ve been through is enough and i need worse to happen to me. It doesn’t help when i’m hypomanic like i am right now with the urge to just make it worse, stop taking meds abandon all sleep do everything i can because even at a baseline i can’t function like a normal human, only if i’m “hypomanic”. Why can’t i go through enough why do i act like i’m in so much mental pain when i don’t even have a reason."
Nightmares,
Preventing relapse?,
How I’ve been feeling lately,
I wrote poem about BD,"It might not be perfect becouse it is transtaliton, and I'm not natvie; but I want to share it with you."
A Poem About Mania,"I wrote this poem while dealing with the aftermath of my first and only manic episode, and thought I should share in case anyone can relate."
Sad I Can't Cry,"I (24M) been diagnosed for four years now. I have been stable for two. I don't like that although I'm no longer having episodes and am relatively stable when I feel like finally releasing up all this pent up sadness I got from always feeling depressed I can't. The tears literally don't come out, or they start to and then stop. I used to cry and feel better before and now I can't even do that. I don't know if anyone could relate?"
think my seasonal mania has started.,"All day today I’ve been extra derealized and irritable, an argument with my mother probably didn’t help and could have definitely triggered it but I’m feeling very in “lala"" land at the moment. I’ve noticed my eyes are wider/more blown and I’m blinking less, which happens when I’m entering an episode."
"Those of you which experience melancholic depression, i need some help",Hi!I am bp2 with melancholic features. So my cyrcadian rhytm is pretty all over the place. Mostly i go to sleep at 12 am or at 11 am and wake up anywhere from 5 am (but manage to get back to sleep again) same story for 7 am and so on. For example today i woke up earlier( cant remember the hour) and got out of bed at 10 am and i felt so miserable until 3pm when my mood is starting to get better a bit but is still depressed.
How do you cope with suicidal tendencies?,
Anyone every experienced this with Bipolar Disorder?,"I went to bed at midnight on Friday night. The wife then entered our bedroom and woke me up. I asked her, ""What time is it?"" She replied, ""It's 6."" I responded, ""Why are you up so early on a Saturday?"" Her reply was, ""PM."""
Changes in the way my symptoms appears since starting medication,Hi!
Self portrait of hypomania and depression,
Brain scan?,"I recently moved to a new state and went to a new therapist. She received great reviews on the few sites I checked, so I felt good going into the appointment.  The first 45 minutes or so went really well - typical questions about my past, prior therapy sessions, medication, etc.  She then told me she's intuitive, and psychic.  I do not believe in these things (nothing against those who do) and then started recommended different doctors and a brain scan to confirm a bipolar diagnosis.  I've been medicated for years for a bipolar diagnosis.  Has anyone ever had a brain scan to confirm or help with a bipolar diagnosis? I really liked her up until the point of the psychic comment and the pushing toward a brain scan.  She also pushed supplements for brain health.  Any input is appreciated."
I think the meds are changing my life and I’m so glad to be here for it,"I was re-diagnosed with bipolar disorder (unspecified) again last week. I didn’t stick to meds the first time around, but decided to just believe and take it seriously this time."
Weird disorientation and fear,I’m having these really weird spells lately and wondered if anyone has had the same experience/knows what this is.
I Get Electroshock Regularly,"My mood is still Anhedonic, even though electroshock should fix that. I have a hard time finding things worth doing. It’s close to Summer Solstice, there should be tons of things to do outside considering that it gets dark as late as possible and yet I have a hard time figuring out what I want to spend my time doing. It’s like I’ve lost all interest in all things and I can’t think about going on except purely for self-preservation’s sake; which is way too basic to be a reason to get up in the morning and live one’s life."
Diagnosed BP2 last week (for the 4th time) think it may actually be sinking in this time,"Since I was diagnosed first in 2019 with Bipolar1 (which was incorrect, def a 2) I’ve just brushed it off as something that will go away with time, it was my fault for not working to be more balanced with diet sleep etc. so I did a lot of self work (I am very hard on myself) worked through trauma, quit drinking and drugs, etc, and still have these suspiciously “up” (hypomania) periods of time where I am invincible on top of the world, going to the gym every single day, forgetting to eat, obsessing with perfecting a skill, VERY Very productive - and following comes the very obvious “burnout” (depression) completely “lazy” and unmotivated, horribly mean to myself about losing interest in a skill I was obsessed with the week before…which I’ve dealt with so long that I’ve normalized."
Sisyphus,
Is apathy its own kind of episode?,My diagnosis was recently changed from bipolar type two to ‘full on bipolar’ (my psychs words).
Recurring mania,"Hi everyone! So this is my first time uploading on this subreddit but, I have something to ask to others with bipolar more specifically ones who are more often in manic/hypomanic episodes, I have extremely rapid cycling bipolar 1 and this year in 2023 I've so far had about 6 manic episodes... yep, it sounds a bit unbelievable even I don't believe it but I look back of all the symptoms of whenever it happens it most definitely is mania, but okay so one of my more specific ways I can mania is actually there is I begin to actually starve myself unintentionally and I get physically repulsed by all food, even if I try to eat it it tastes so bland to me that it makes me lose my appetite even more and this usually happens for about a week and then it ends and I eat like normal and my mood is normal... I usually try to calm the mania and unintentional starvation down with weed and when I run out the mania returns and it's just another vicious cycle... I hope this story isn't all over the place it's kind of hard trying to catch my grip on my thoughts while writing this but yes, I'd like to know if anyone else has that warning sign to mania."
I don't understand what I am feeling,"I keep getting this feeling where I am restless/get the urge to move. The urge is so strong that it makes me physically feel unwell. It's almost like there's something in my chest trying to get out. And I try to move around (exercise, a hobby, even pacing my room) , to get rid of the feeling, but when the feeling is there nothing makes it go away. I am on 5mg of abilify daily but idk if I can attribute this feeling to the medication (unlikely bc I had it before the medication), hypomania, or something completely different. Does anyone else ever get this feeling? Do you know how to make it go away? Lately the feeling has been getting worse and legitimately makes me contemplate some bad things."
"26M,bipolar 2,depression-hypomanic-depression phase ,back to work","I’m a 26M ,with bipolar 2,borderline personality and anxiety disorder. 2 weeks ago I had a terrible depressive episode which transitioned to a hypomanic phase for about 5 days then back to a depressive phase for the last 1 week. I’ve been excused from work because of the crisis. I’m to resume work today,but I’ve been in a depressive state for the past 1 week ,my meds make me drowsy when I wake up in the morning. I’ll go see the psychologist today to clear me for work ,if he deems me fit then I’ll return to work"
I thought I was stable and in remission,"I felt a manic episode coming on just over a month ago and basically spent half a week asleep because I'm super sensitive to my Quetiapine when I'm like this. Now it feels like I've hit a brick wall like I have ever winter since 2013. I've spent this entire lomg weekend trying to tidy the depression mess that is my apartment, I've lost all interest in sex, eating is hard even when I've cooked nice things I'm craving or I'll bingeing chocolate, none of my hobbies are worth doing, I feel physically weak which is making my one bit of exercise a week (pole) extremely hard, leaving the house is terrifying, I'm struggling with work and everything just sucks right now. I know it'll pass when the weather warms up but man...I need to take extra care of myself right now and try not to lose my job. I've also purposely triggered my PTSD by filing a police report against someone so that's fun but it has to be done for my own sake."
How do you manage not sleeping ?,"I’ve slept a total of less than 20 hours in the last 4 days. I’m moody, irritable, exhausted , but can’t sleep . I’ll lay in bed hours and not fall asleep even though I’ll meditate as well. I’ve been argumentative and rude and can’t tell if I’m in an episode or if I’m just tired…. I’m on Latuda and lithium so I thought I wouldn’t really have any episodes. I’m starting to get work out now and depressed lately and not wanting to do anything so I’m hoping I can get sleep…. How do you manage the lack of sleep? Do you do anything to help yourself get back on track?"
Is this enough to call my doctor?,"Over the past few weeks I've been thrown off by my surroundings (not being able to recognize my neighbourhood when I'm walking, and I walk everyday), been paranoid about aliens coming to get me (this only lasted a few days), and some visual ""hallucinations""(?) like seeing bugs out of the corner of my eyes for several minutes or seeing light flashes when I'm in the dark. Is this just my brain tricking itself or should I contact my doctor? I don't want a med increase for nothing. Thanks :)"
I just pushed away my only friends,My friend said something jokingly and I was like haha I’m gonna block you!! And he said “omg finally..” and I lost it I blocked him on everything and his friend too they were my only friends and it’s been three months and I’ve been alone rotting in my bed in a depressive episode.
driving as a mania trigger??,"guys what on earth happens to me chemically when i enter my vehicle???? it feels like i shift from depression to mania in an instant. if i get into my car past 6pm and turn on music, i can feel my manic personality start to emerge. i always feel like i want to go somewhere were i can find someone to manipulate into being in love with me. the hypersexuality and substances desire is soon to follow. is this something that happens to other people or is this bespoke to me? i know a lot of us become bad drivers after we’re manic, but does anyone get manic just from driving?"
Anyone in a successful relationship with someone who has bipolar?,"A while back I made a depressing post about if I’ll ever find someone due to my Bipolar 2. Within it I explained in great detail about why I was thinking that way due to my struggles, realizations, growing points, and not to mention I keep seeing a lot of failed relationship stories too."
i made it to 17.,i didn’t think i’d make it this far to be honest. i’ve dealt with so much abuse and mental health problems that i always assumed id be gone by now. so i guess i’m just proud of myself for still being here :)
Diagnosis and self harm,"Hi. To start out with I’m a 24 year old gay male, who has had slight behavioral and mood problems since my mid teen years. Lots of issues at home as a kid, psychological and physically abusive step parents you know? Well my issues continued to get more and more frequent as an adult. Then when July hit last year, everything in my life absolutely blew up. I stopped sleeping, eating, caring about the state of my home. Calling off work frequently to the point I almost lost my job. Had black outs in memory, to the extent where I “woke up” on the ground in a corn field in the middle of a small thunderstorm. I had drove my car 7 miles away from home and parked on the side of the road near the field and walked through one of the plow lanes and fell back. I don’t know how long I was there. I don’t remember driving there or walking through the fields. I started hearing things, at home and at work. People calling my name when nobody was around, I heard my grandma talking to me. And she’s been dead for 12 years. Then it got to the point of hallucinations. Then I’d start to see my grandma, and the worst part was when I walked into my house and saw my stepfather running at me fist raised. He had been dead a year at that point and I hadn’t seen him in 9. Along with those I was seeing people in the darkness, watching me wherever I went. In the shadows of my house and at work. And at times it’d be like I had a United Nations Council going on in my head with so much talking I couldn’t comprehend it. And other times it would only be 4 or 5 voices at a time, and they would all sound like me, but they’d all say different things and it was like all the different parts of me were telling me what to do. As a result, one day when my head was splitting from all the congestion and screaming I took one of the things I was working on at work (I’m a welder), and pressed it deep into the exposed flesh under my PPE. That started to make things easier, it hurt so much I was able to focus on that instead of the circus I was seeing and hearing. So that’s what I kept on doing. Now despite this, I knew everything I was seeing and hearing wasn’t real. I knew my grandma and stepfather were dead. I knew the shadow people I kept seeing weren’t real. But the burning was the only way to help. There would be periods of time where I’d be okay, I wouldn’t sleep but I wouldn’t be tired. And then I’d start sleeping with any and all men who would have me without a second thought. That lead to me being sexually assaulted and almost killed at the hands of a dangerous man. But despite that I’d continue. I maxed out my credit cards within a month and was $10,000 in debt. I’d spend paychecks on things I didn’t need and then couldn’t pay my bills. And I started drinking more frequently, but not enough to where I’d be considered an alcoholic. I put myself in more dangerous situations. Speeding 20-40 miles over the limit, passing cars with cars approaching closely on the other side, trespassing on the stone quarry near my house, trying to climb the water tower near my house (and failing because it was raining and I kept slipping), wearing my headphones with loud music and my eyes closed on highly trafficked train tracks. Finally one day one of my coworkers was messing with me to the point where I thought I was hallucinating again. And it got to the point where I ran from work without a word to anyone. I went to the mental health clinic at my home town which was 12 miles away. After filling out the paperwork it took 3 weeks to get in with a clinical psychologist. When I did I told her everything, it took 4 sessions over a month to get everything in the air. My friends and family were unaware of the self harm. But they all agreed that at that time the psychologist should have had me hospitalized. She got me set up with a psychiatric nurse practitioner, who diagnosed me with Bipolar 1 with acute mania and psychotic disorder after reading everything in my chart and talking with me. And after my diagnose, my mother revealed that she received the same diagnoses after a suicide attempt 7 years past when she was in a psychiatric facility. She said based on her mother and her grandmother’s life and behavior they likely had the same."

Grandiosity,So I've been in mantic episode for the last 2 weeks just thinking that my life is worth something somebody would want to know like my children from my disastrous childhood to my disastrous marriage to the self-destructive behavior that is me that I have decided to write a book I am six chapters deep and now I'm spiraling down and I'm starting to doubt myself and I'm starting to doubt why I even did it I found myself erasing half of the stuff I wrote because I don't want to hurt anybody else's feelings and you know even if it just ends up being a journal it felt good getting it out and not having anybody go wow you live through that yeah I lived through that and I'm fine don't don't bring it up again but here I bring it up to myself and I don't know why it's like constantly playing the remember win game with people I asked them remember when this happened so that I can reassure myself that memory number two that I really want to bring up really happened cuz it happened the same day I'm bringing it just does that make any sense to anybody else like I'm so afraid to bring up memory number two because of the scars that it bares forget I need to remind myself s*** that happened and then triggers my PTSD I don't know if this makes sense to anybody else I'm just the ramblings of a mad woman
My meds take away my love of music?,"In the past few months I have been prescribed a few different medications. But with each of them I find the only downside has been I have lost my love of music? Music used to be an outlet for me to let go of some of my emotions and I used to sing loud and proud. But now while driving in the car all songs either irritate me or I just can't find it inside myself to sing along anymore, and the only change in my life is the medications. Has anyone else has similar problems?"
Don’t know if this is a mixed episode?,Think I’m in a mixed ep rn because I decided to take my parents Wellbutrin to help get out of a depressive episode I’ve been in since university. The first few days were great energy wise but yesterday it started to change and I woke up wired and Slept like 4 hours last night because I was too wound up. I’ve Been doing puzzles all week to work my brain around and target to something positive. I think I’m spending money on stupid shit (seriously already broke asf) I’ve spent like $400 the past week or so and now only have about $1000 to my name.  I bought fidget toys more puzzles and lots of “fancy” foods and skincare products and random things that I find cute. But the irritability is so bad I’ve been dog sitting for my parents and ||I almost hit my dog and have been yelling at her whenever she whines|| Ik that sounds awful but she’s making this way harder. My mood has been fantastic for the most part but intense anxiety. Thoughts racing like crazy not necessarily with ideas but more paranoia (it’s always fucking paranoia never euphoria for long). What sucks about only having hypo and also having ADHD is that no one around me notices it (why it was a shocker when I was diagnosed) it’s hard to distinguish an episode from just being happy because I feel great rn but not at the same time. I have no idea whither or not this is an episode like I’m tired but I’m not if that makes sense.

Recognizing other bipolar people,"Idk why, but sometimes I know when somebody Is bipolar/ autistic. Sometimes I can tell someone is bipolar by just looking at them or when I feel their presence in the room I know. And sometimes Im bold enough to ask them if they’re bipolar and they usually say yes. Does this happen to anyone else?"

Just sharing.,"I haven’t been able to sleep at a normal time, for about 2 months now. I’m frustrated. I want a normal sleep schedule & to stick to a routine. I want to go to the gym & eat better & I just can’t stick to shit. i’m tired of how i look, looking at myself. I’m bipolar + schizoaffective. Or however you phrase that. One time I got so scared to go outside & be near the street I missed my whole sophomore year. It’s ruining my life again. & Now, I’m scared because bpd is ruining my fucking life again i’m sinking & i just want to get out. I’m so unhappy. My dr prescribed me medication but my insurance hasn’t approved it yet & I just am at my end with how hard I have to fight with my brain just to live. & no one understands. Does this ever go away?

Alien paranoia after watching a documentary,"I watched a documentary on aliens two different times in the past three years. After each time, I became paranoid for a couple weeks thinking aliens were out to get me. I had to sleep with the lights on and kept thinking I would see an alien in the window or house randomly. This would mostly occur at night. I never did see one. I was diagnosed BD2 last year and I’m wondering if they were symptoms of delusion or something else. Has anyone ever experienced this?"

Advice for Bipolar testing?,I’m meeting with a person who tests people for Bipolar Disorder in a few days and I’m nervous and don’t really know what to expect. Does anyone have any experiences that may help me get an idea of what might happen at the appointment?
Seeing a Psych for the first time in 3+ years (Bipolar 2),"I'm (30M) the worst i've been in as long as I can remember.  I left an emotionally and on a couple occasions physically abusive relationship in January, met someone (23F and BPD) on bumble/went on our first date in March. I was smitten immediately. Talked to her constantly, always wanted to spend time with her though she was a bit busy and had some unfortunate life events happen. Well last week I brought up I brought up that her communication hadn't felt the same, and that's when she admitted she was splitting from me and that she would only want to try and be friends and nothing more for the time being. I broke, cause it felt like the first time in a long time I met someone who genuinely shared very similar interests and understood me. The next day she said my feelings felt manipulative, and were triggering her. Her therapist said she should lose contact with me for a while. Let me just say I did not once threaten suicide or self harm, which i am very proud of myself for. I spammed my snapchat story with music, and tried asking her if she atleast wanted to see eachother in person to which she replied no, understandable. No we're in no contact and I have to respect her decision. By Friday I couldn't handle looking at myself I contacted a Psychiatrist that morning and scheduled an appointment for this coming week."
How can I get energy when depressed,"I had 10 hours of sleep last night. I went on a walk this morning. I have eaten breakfast. I have even taken a nap. I cannot get myself to wakeup, but I need to get out of bed again. I feel like I shouldn't expect all of the activities I did this morning to do sonething, but sometimes, all I need is to eat breakfast. What do y'all do to get up, or get energy during a depression spike. I'm also a bit confused, because I feel like this depression spike is a little random. Usually it takes me a day or a few to swing from mania to depression, and I'm not apathetic like I usually would be during depression, so I'm not sure if that's what this even is. Like I'm p sure I have been on an upward swing, and didn't expect to become bed ridden."
Really struggling with ups and downs,I had a really good week last week.  Started a new job.  Continued eating healthy and exercising regularly.  Working on my recovery very well.  Great sleep.  Clean and organized.
Buying meds,Do you notice the look you get from the pharmacist whenever you pick up your meds or maybe it’s all in my mind? I always feel like they give me the sad or pity look knowing that I am dealing with Bipolar.
I CAN’T SLEEP,Currently on day 4 of my first tolerance break from weed in 2 years. I don’t know if smoking was keeping my mania in check but it’s building fast and the idea of eating or sleeping is quickly slipping away. Any recommendations on how to handle it?
Having a lot of lows lately,"Lately I've been having more depressive episodes. Almost every night it seems. I keep seeing stuff that makes me sad or upset on FB from friends. Or sometimes on reddit. But, I do have bipolar depression and I guess it's kicking my butt now. But I have been on 3 medicines for it and anxiety. I don't know what to do. I don't think my doctor will listen but she's really the only one in town. I can try at my next appointment though. How do you manage lows when you've been fine all day? I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to be in that dark place again."

Support network,
Indecisive brain,"I have so many thoughts about what I want to do with my life as far as going to school. I have a well thought out plan, I note the reasons of why I want to go into that field and then I go on spiral of other things I could go to school for. Now I have no idea what to do. I apply to community colleges, get in and then before it's too late to withdraw I get out. I have been doing this for years. I know I could probably mount to something but I'm constantly afraid of failing. I do have a job but it's not something I want to do forever. I'm 29 and I know it's not too late to go to school but this circle of getting a job and not loving it but sticking to it because what else am I going to do, is soooo draining. Does anyone else go through this? Did you ever figure it out?"
starting my first job!,"I’m 19F and have bipolar disorder, OCD, and PTSD.

The first two years of college I never went to class and basically only registered for online courses. I have never had a job due to my debilitating depression and anxiety. I ended the year with good grades and start my first job on Monday!!! I’m going to be an aid at a daycare. While I’m super excited, I’m also very nervous because I know how slippery of a slope my moods can be, especially when drained or tired. I wanted to know if anyone had any advice. Thanks in advance :)<3"
Sleepwalking on seroquel,"Anyone else dealing with sleepwalking while taking seroquel? I woke up one morning to cat litter in my bathtub and my roommate claimed she heard me fumbling in my room the night prior. When I was younger I had instances where I’d walk into the living after I’d fallen asleep and would just stare at my family members or cry. A few nights ago I started doing it again, only now to my roommate. Anyone else notice this sort of thing? I’ve made mention of it to my meds provider but it seems like she doesn’t believe me."
Downplaying hyposexuality,
Do you live with anxiety of another episode,I suffered through 2 years of manic/depressive episodes with little to no time in between at base level. I was formally diagnosed this year and have finally had stability for the last few months with only a minor episode since then.
"Is ""hearing sounds that aren't there but pretty normal in madness scale"" concerning?","I know it's stupid but I have a fear of the flat above me's waste water coming to my bathroom. It's like a stupid obsession. I asked the landlord multiple times, he said it's not possible. I hear dripping sounds but don't see any water. Sometimes I feel like my hair got wet from a drop, I check with my hand and either I feel it too but there is no wetness on my head or I don't feel it at all. I feel water dropping on my feet but don't see it. I do my businness quick in the bathroom but it stresses me out. Is it really concerning? it's been there for like a year."
Butterflies in stomach - early sign of manic episode???,"Okay so I'm quite new to bipolar disorder symptoms, I honestly didn't know how serious this illness is.. I was ""diagnosed"" with borderline personality disorder before I turned 18 and it seemed legit, it helped me understand how my mind works, what triggers me and why, etc."
Psychiatric ward stays,"Edit: Thanks so much for all the support everyone. Your words have made today a lot more positive. I'm pretty exhausted so I'm not going to reply to everyone, but I've read every comment and you've really made me feel a lot better about my situation. So glad I have this community to turn to when things get tough."
"Bipolar and burnt-out, looking for accommodations","I’m diagnosed with bipolar I and adhd. I work in controlled agriculture and it’s very fast-paced. I work about 50-55 hours a week. I love my job on paper, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to even show up due to my disability. I’m exhausted and I just don’t feel like this current situation is sustainable."
"As hard as I have worked to be free of them, I miss the highs and lows at times.","Life just feels ordinary now.  Bland.  Like all the ultra violent bright colors are missing.  I keep waiting for something spectacular to happen, but nothing does.  Is this what stability feels like?"
Older/not hella young bipolar people,Does is get better after 25? Once my brain is fully grown does it get easier to manage? I know that life makes more sense and in general it’s better but did you notice a change in your symptoms?
what's having a psychotic break like?,"it sucks being a pretty logical person with bipolar. when i'm hypomanic i can tell. when i'm manic manic, i don't feel manic, even if i can often objectively tell i am."
Two weeks stable,"And I’m hopeful. It’s been a long time since I’ve been stable and I’m eager for this to continue. Please, this has to continue."
Tired of talk therapy,I have been having talking therapy almost every week since Aug/September last year. To be honest I don't know what I talk about.
I'm sad,I will just post this on here so I don't bother anyone of my loved one with my dramas.
Minecraft save my life,"You guys heard of Minecraft, right? If you do I want to share a story this story when I was 11 when I had my 2nd depression. It was about January of 2019, I was starting to feel sad, maybe it was just because my family from far way homes were living or it was because I was starting to have thoughts like ""maybe I'm god and I'm the only person who is real? maybe I made this world because I was lonely and I want to create an illusion for me so I don't feel lonely?"" Thinking about all of this made me feel pain in my chest, I want it not to be true. Even though I was feeling all of this, I still have Wonder my Minecraft world. Even though it was just a line of code, but it helped me cope, it distracted me from my thoughts, and it made me smile even though it was hard to smile, I still have the thought but it's like my delusions and Minecraft world were sound I hear both of them, My delusions started loud but eventually the sound of my Minecraft world were louder than my delusions, after months it just went away I don't know how or when it went away but it did. So I'm thankful for you WONDERRRRRR for helping me cope with depression. Rest in peace WONDERRRRR I will remeber you, I will always keep you next to my heart! I forgot to mention I was only 11 and I have no concept of what depression is."
Just been diagnosed with BP 2 and i have some questions to try to better understand it,"Hi! I had 5 years history of GAD, depression for which i took 25 Zoloft, and some hypomanic episodes that no one took seriously until i got filmed how was behaving and described my psychiatrist how i was feeling."
is it common for doctors to not explain dx to you?,"the first time i was hospitalized my doctors didn’t explain anything to me about my dx at all. nothing about mania or my symptoms, hell, they didn’t even tell me my diagnosis!! i found out later when i was getting my meds. is this common??? insight wouldve helped me so much, i only know anything about the disorder from my own research."
Burning bridges and friendships,Hey everyone. For most of my life I grew up extremely secluded and isolated from the world (homeschooled by my abusive mom until I was 16). I didn’t have any social interaction really and didn’t have friends as a child until I got to high school.

Broken off 8 year relationship and confused,"So, I ended my 8 year relationship this week due to some infidelity on his side. I was told only part of the story in February and I turned manic - bpd and bipolar mix does not bode when with rejection hypersensitivity. Well, I found out this week that he'd done something worse than that and I broke it off. Only, I've felt absolutely nothing. Few tears and shouting here and there, but not the gut renching pain I felt in February. This is really confusing for me because I expected a huge breakthrough episode, but completely numb. I feel really betrayed, so I dont think my mind/body can take it and shut down as a result. Everyone is confused because I don't normally react to situations like this."
SO doesn’t believe my symptoms are real,"English is not my first language, sorry for any possible mistakes Im 26, had depressive episodes through out my whole life, got diagnosed with ADHD at 23yo and 2 years ago after a really bad hypomania (cheating, maxing out credit cards, drug abuse) I got diagnosed bipolar at 24yo. Both runs on both sides of my family so…. Me and my SO went through a really rough fase trying to repair all the damage I’ve done. We are doing a lot better now. I know the disorder is not responsible for everything I’ve done, now that I’m diagnosed I realise how I’ve could’ve tried to avoid/control it. Since then I’ve been taking lamotrigine, latuda and going to weekly therapy sessions, which are keeping me stable. I’m very aware of symptoms now. The whole healing process after my hypomania gave me traumas, things were said and cant be taken back, some wounds are still healing, and thats ok. But every now and then when we have occasional conversations about things that happened he freaks out. Every single time my diagnoses comes up my SO tries to invalidate my symptoms. He always begs me to be open and communicate about any issues I might be having with my mental health, but when I confide in him and bring up some symptoms I’m struggling with he dismisses it saying thats not the disorder, I’m just a bad person trying to justify bad things I’ve done."
Are there any doctors with bipolar disorder on here?,I’m bipolar type 1 and an aspiring doctor. I was wondering if anyone has had experience with invasive questions sometimes asked by certain licensing boards and if disclosing your illness impacted your ability to become a doctor?
“I’ve never been manic or hypomanic so how am I bipolar?”,"Me trying to convince my psychiatrist that I wasn’t bipolar, and her confirming that I am. Only to be hypomanic a month later causing her to “worry” about me."
Moving anxiety and depression,"I’ve rented the house I’m in for 5 years now and that’s longer than I’ve ever lived anywhere (my mom and I moved all over the place when I was young). I’m moving in a couple of weeks to a much smaller home, in a brand new town, and I have to sell pretty much everything I own in order to fit into this new place. I’ve also just started college for the first time at 26 and overwhelmed would be an understatement… I know I’ll survive, I’ve moved so many times and I’ve been fine, I’m just sad to lose a place that finally felt like a home. I have no one to share my sadness with because everyone just brushes it off or doesn’t understand. Maybe I’m too attached and emotional about it. I guess I just needed to vent, or need some advice on staying stable during all of the abrupt changes. I feel like I’m hanging by a thread and I can’t afford to snap right now with everything that’s going on."
Why do we have spending problems,Like why?? I try so hard to save and I fight the urge but I lose everytime. it’s like one of my main symptoms. I just got done spending 200-300 on random shit that I DONT NEED and I probably don’t want after this high. What is it about spending money that is a “getaway” from our feelings? Is it the satisfaction? The self sabotage? Both? Ugh… I just want to save money like everyone else….. anyone have any tips??
Does anyone have weird dream when they’re manic?,"I’ve been manic or hypomanic for almost a week and I’ve noticed I have very weird, extremely vivid dreams only when I’m in this state of mind. Any time else I don’t dream this vividly, but now the little sleep I do get is stuffed with dreams that are so vivid it takes me awhile to remember whether they actually happened or not when I wake up. The past four days I’ve pulled all-nighters and then have been taking a small nap in the morning, about 4-5 hours of waking up every hour and intense dreams when I am asleep. Does anyone else experience this? It’s so weird, it feels like I’m not sleeping when I am asleep."
Being a mom,"Hi, people. I'm a newish mom and am having some serious difficulties. I decided to go back to work part time after 10 month of my fiest baby and i thought I could handle it, but am slowly realizing that my life and house are falling apart since I started back. I'm going thru medication changes and struggling to keep everything together. I've got a husband thats been as helpful as can be but he works long hrs and comes home exhausted so i try to ask for help but because of med changes and stress ive been taking it out on him even when he tries to help. I'm living in a home with my mother because life's expensive and she's somewhat helpful with the baby but not with me. She acts as if I'm selfish and lazy; she doesn't remember or act as if I have a disorder, she acts more as if I'm normal."
Weight Gain Seroquel,Hi! Never been on this sub before but thought it might be helpful for me.. please delete if not allowed.
Diagnosis changed from type 2 to type 1.,My new psych was SHOCKED that I was diagnosed with type 2 when I explained how my mania is. She said I never even should have been diagnosed with type 2 when I was presenting with full blown mania.
social media makes life with a mental illness 10x worse,"80% of my manic regrets come from shit i’ve posted to hundreds of people on my social media accounts, or things i’ve messaged people while manic. it sucks having an illness that throws you out of control in a world where you can really make yourself seen to a very large audience. and it makes everything 10x more embarrassing. sometimes i wish i was born before technology so i could just be crazy without making it known to so many people. way less embarrassing"
little signs ur getting hypomanic,sorry i post a lot. what are those super tiny signs for you? more of mine are saying good morning to every customer in the drive through and also i start getting super empathetic towards insects and animals ( i feel so bad killing a fly because imagine you’re just living like and ur dead the next second:( ) and also when i’m stable i don’t have energy to do anything thus not being medicated for the mania so happily listening to music and ORGANIZING!! i don’t like cleaning but organizing is soooo so fun to me. when i start getting the urge to organize my adhd piles of stuff ik something’s up 😂 also weirdly enough i can tell because my brain starts going ur gonna get into an episode i love yall i hope you’re having a great day/evening:))
How soon after starting seeing someone do I need to tell them I am bipolar?,"I (f) just started seeing another woman, we’ve only been on one date but we have plans to see each other again in less than a week.

I don't want to think I'm manic,
Anyone have Bipolar + BPD?,"I've had the diagnosis of both in the past at a young age (multiple times) but really just ignored them because I was “determined to be fine” and went off of meds and therapy but now the patterns seem very obvious and are debilitating and I think there is truth to them now. Have new psychiatrist appointment soon and trying to find the right therapist covered by Medicaid. I'm curious to know what other's experiences may be with this because it seems there is an underlying clear ""happy/mania"" phase and then long depressive stretches but then the day to day, constant emotional toil of BPD still progresses. Please share. Am really struggling right now and feel like I need community who understands. Just moved a little while back and have almost no one."
How do you get over the trauma of going to the ward?,"It feels like a mix of the hospital itself - the troubled inmates, overworked staff, etc - and the experience of being full-blown manic for the first time, but ever since my first admission I've been sensing that people respond differently to me, as if my personality has changed. I definitely feel different in myself, possibly due to the fear that my internal world might collapse without me knowing it (during my first mania I was the last person to know that anything was wrong). How do other people manage the changes that occur after a break down? And is it possible to get back to the way we used to be?"
Just got diagnosed with PTSD,"All because of how traumatic and overly long my bipolar 'manifestation ' was (4-5 months), which included 2 psych overnight stays at the ER, a voluntary 7 day psych ward visit and an involuntary visit for a few hours (not enough honestly)."
New resting symptoms,"Ever since I was diagnosed with bipolar/ had my first episode I’ve noticed that something will change with my brain every time I have an episode. I don’t mean when I’m manic or depressed but when I am at a resting state of a stable mood. Also, doesn’t have to be after an episode it could be after having some existential event like a major life change. Major example is having a voice in my head almost like having a imaginary friend. Another example is feeling emotions 10x as strong as I did in the past. Also, I can have inner dialogue that almost feels like I’m talking to the same room. And also I have physical reaction almost like tic that might make me my smile or cringe depending what I’m feeling. Recently , I feel like I have more love emotions 10x as strong when I interact with people even though exchanges may be small and insignificant. I consistently communicate these changes to my therapist but since I’m stable he doesn’t think that it’s not much of a problem and it isn’t. Does anybody also have stable resting state “abilities” that might be related to bipolar even though you haven’t undergone psychosis and are completely normal b"
I’m just so lonely,"I have friends.. or like one, I have lots of family, I have a husband but yet every time I bring up my mental illnesses and my struggles it’s like people are confused at why I act the way I do or their uninterested in me and anything I have to say.. I just feel so isolated… wish I could find similar or more compassionate people in real life. It’s just me myself and I, it’s tiring."
350 calorie snack ideas?,i’ve recently been put on latuda and i don’t eat 3 meals a day to begin with so i want something that’s small but has 350 calories. any ideas? i’m allergic to nuts and don’t eat meat so it can’t be that.
Generally apprehensive about my current mood state. Would appreciate a community online hug 🫂,"I’ve been stable for two years and kind of thought the worst was behind me, but I feel like I may be in the midst of a mixed episode. Had to take a month off work for stress, but felt like a fraud because I normally only take time off when I’m on the verge of psychosis or super bad depression. I’m back working now, but I’m struggling with concentration and getting feelings of rejection from friends based off of nothing at all. In fact they’re constantly validating me at the moment. Then on the flip side I’ve picked up like 3 new hobbies fairly intensely, am moving house at the end of the month and planning a wedding for October. I’m losing quite a lot of weight too, which was needed, and have a heart health scare ongoing. Like, I know I’m going to be fine, but I just feel so on edge. The medications have kept me stable for so long, and therapy got me to a really good place when I stopped a year ago. Going to start therapy back up next week and considering whether to ask my GP to refer me to a psychiatrist again to check the prescription."
Bipolar and Chronic Physical Illness,"Does anyone else have Bipolar and an ongoing physical illness or disability? For example, I was diagnosed Bipolar 1 ten years ago and I was finally getting the hang of it all and then over the last year I developed Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and I’m very couch or bed bound with very little energy. Recently I think I was manic for the first time after having developed CFS but since I have no bodily energy or a low ability to move it was a very strange experience. My mind was busy and racing but my body can’t do anything to expend the energy. Which is a good thing to avoid negative behaviors but also felt like being trapped in a way! I needed to rest and sleep but couldn’t for days. Can anyone relate? What does this feel like for other people? How does your illness or disability affect your Bipolar?"
Preemptive preparation for hypomania?,"I had a BIT of a mood shift last weekend, unbeknownst to myself. I wanted to stay out all night, get (multiple) piercings AND tattoos, and have loads of sex (even made some crazier plans for the following weekend..snapped out of it prior to those bad choices though). Only when my friend suggested hypomania after I told her I felt “rabid” did it (eventually) actually click. After the fact it was extremely obvious (haha)."
Rant about how people treat me,"I’m tired. I’m 22, work full time, pretty functional, I’m in therapy, got my meds in an ok spot but it’s still so hard. I try so hard to be normal and have normal reactions, so so hard, I constantly hide and I rarely hang out or speak to my friends because it’s to hard to hide it 24/7. Sometimes a bit slips out, I feel like I have the plague and if I sniffle once suddenly I’m a freak show or a bratty kid. I’m really struggling with new management at my job. For context I work at a very chill and open minded small business, it’s a job I used to really enjoy. My old manager and me are extremely close and his wife has a mood disorder. With him I felt very connected and in the loop with my other managers and higher ups. New manager is the complete opposite, didn’t even know what manic meant. For about a month I was on the wrong meds and went through a mixed mania phase, now I feel like anything I have to say is ignored or dismissed as me just being the resident nut job. That shift has been extremely hard for me, my boss doesn’t like me as much, I’m written up far more, chastised for small mistakes, and am pulled aside for meetings that feel like I’m a child being scolded. All while feeling out of the loop with the rest of management. I do not feel comfortable telling upper management that I’m in a depressive or manic state to request shifts in work load, not being able to tell anyone to get accommodations has made me dislike a job that once made me extremely happy. I understand I’ll have to work until I’m dead, work is awful, and any tolerable work is good work but good damn going from being open about my struggles and getting support to being treated like a child is really fucking with me. I don’t want to quit cause I know everything else is worse or the same, I’m paid liveable wage, and I like the job and staff. I’m really considering trying to work for myself but I don’t have faith I could be consistent in it."
I feel I am mostly out of my depression,"I have been taking Lamictal for a little over a month now. I started at 25mg, increased to 50mg, and have been at 100mg for almost three weeks now. At the beginning, I still felt depressed and was struggling to do basic things. However, as time went on and my dose increased, my mood started to improve and doing daily things became easier. It is not a perfect drug, but this is working the best for me out of all the 10+ meds I’ve tried over the past ten months. I am also tracking my mood using Daylio and it’s so great to have so many good days in a row. That was unheard of before I was medicated! So what I want to say is to give your meds time to work!"
Regretting my manic haircut,"I do this every year. My hair finally grows to a length I feel beautiful and confident with, I have an episode, and then it’s all gone and I wake up feeling ugly and unkempt. And that feeling won’t go away for months, maybe another year until it grows back. It just sucks to feel so out of control, and to have outsiders think I am only upset about the hair. I am upset about the hair. But I’m more upset to have a visual reminder to me and everyone else that my illness sometimes runs my life."
Bipolar with pets?,"Hi Reddit, I’ve been struggling with my cat for the past couple of months and wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar. (I’m medicated)"
always depressed or hypo,how’s it going guys! i was just reading up on some stuff abt bipolar 2 and it pointed out more times than not people w bp2 are constantly in an episode of depression or mania. For me that’s pretty true any of you also experience this? id love to hear about episode patterns if you’ve noticed any:))
How does everyone deal with break thru episodes ?,Ok so when taking meds as prescribed with no “no no” substance use how do you handle it when you start to cycle due to a trigger? I’m really working hard to avoid as many of these break thru episodes as possible but life is just stressful(big trigger) and life ya know? What are some ways you stay grounded?
Own,Flailing like a worm to be picked on by sparrows
I’m finally starting to make some progress!,"I think I’ve only posted here once before. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 13 years ago. (I’m about to turn 26.) It has been a constant struggle to get reliable, consistent treatment."
Facial spasms?,"I take Wellbutrin and Seroquel, and recently I’ve been having involuntary muscle spasms. Sometimes my whole body will randomly jerk or I’ll have a muscle spasm in my arm."
Maintaining healthy relationships,"Hi guys, I need help with how to maintain healthy relationships. I feel I mess up with any person I start seeing in such a short amount of time. I bring things up too early, can get angry and just self sabotage. Because of this I'm ruining chances with good guys. I am good at maintaining friendships nowadays because I can be mature about fights and respect friend's feelings and listen. With romantic relationships things fall apart so fast and it hurts. I have no idea why this happens to me. What should I do to help my reactions towards people I like and control my emotions? I either end up talking romantically with someone who is way more unhealthy mental health wise than me and become a mom and therapist to them and have to end the relationship. On the other hand when the person I'm talking to is not like that and is at the same level or emotionally healthier than me, I become the one who ruins it. I try so hard and it still gets me. I don't know how to change this brain process of mine. I think I have anxious attachment and it shows early into talking to someone new. I have bipolar disorder and some trauma relating to my dad. He's very emotionally abusive still to this day. He's said before that I don't deserve a good guy. Can someone please tell me what helps them maintain a healthy relationship?"

Medicine Induced Tremors?,DISCLAIMER: I am NOT looking to replace medical care. I have an appointment with my psych next week. I am just asking for other's experiences.
On the struggle bus 🚌,Is anyone actually stable like no matter if there’s a sleep disruption or a stressful event? I got my sleep disrupted the other night and it sent me into a spiraling mixed episode and my psych told me to double up on my Seroquel that night and take my prn anxiety med because I refuse to go back to the hospital. Upping the meds seemed to help but now I’m exhausted from them. I feel like there’s no middle ground either I’m well rested but groggy and/or depressed or completely crawling out of my skin and I spiral. I had a few days of what felt like stability when I started Wellbutrin on top of my mood stabilizer and antipsychotics but now the saddies are creeping back in.
Any tips on cleaning after a depressive episode,Im so over whelmed and dont know where to begin. Luckily i forced myself to keep up with the dishes so thats not a big problem but i live in a 5br house with 3 dogs. The floors are disgusting and i have a puppy and shes marking one spot in the house and ive been shit at cleaning that asap. So now my house smells so any and all suggestions are helpful. And a mountain of clean laundry.
How to not dream so much,"Ever since I was a kid I had VIVID dreams every single night. I remember being a kid and every morning I would talk about what my dream was about (they’re always chaotic) and sometimes they would make me laugh or scared or worried. I definitely have lucid dreams/ sleep paralysis - now that I’m older I can control my feelings around my dreams because I have little tricks to recognize when I’m dreaming and I can sometimes (not often) wake myself up. My partner often tells me I laugh, talk and scream in my sleep. I’ve been medicated for about 4 years now and the dreams weren’t so frequent in the beginning but that lasted for a short period of time. Every night I go to bed I get exhausted thinking about my dream. I find myself clenching my jaw so bad (I was told I have TMJ when I was a kid also) that I have pain the next day. The dreams get worse/ more vivid when I’m in an upswing but I’m constantly dreaming manic or not. It’s so exhausting. Does anyone have tips for how to reduce dreams/teeth grinding?"
How can i make life easier for my partner as someone with Bipolar?,Hi!
it's like they make it hard on purpose,"trying to look into getting a bed at my inpatient place and they don't have an email system. ok. guess i'll just have to call. their call line is not 24/7. they'll 'open' at 8AM. on monday. came up with the brilliant idea to email my therapist. realized, again, it's saturday. she may not answer till monday then. fuck. i'm TRYING to go directly there and avoid the extra hospital bills from going to the ER(america sucks btw) but i have no way of getting a hold of any of their offices. for the first time ever i'm trying to get help before attempting and this is how it goes? damn. it really may be easier to just die. i don't know what else i'm supposed to do here."
Self sabotage,Why is it when I have something good going weather it’s a job or an apartment I RUIN it. Is it really the bipolar or can I be just that stupid??? I wish I was a normal person. I can’t do anything right
How do I manage summertime depression?,"In the summer, I get extremely bored being off from school, in this case, college. But now I find myself becoming depressed when I have nothing to do. Plus due to my depression, I don't feel like traveling or going out because I know I won't enjoy myself or would want to go home early."
Bipolar Coping Strategies,"Hi! It’s my first time on the bipolar subreddit because I was looking for a place to ask a question or two and share what’s been going on. I have bipolar depression and it’s taken a toll on my mental health for many years now, but it’s getting a lot better! I was taking a medication for it and seeing a therapist, although I have since lost that form of insurance. I’m still currently looking into treatments but I’m waiting for my insurance to switch over so it’ll be covered again."
I feel crazy. What should I do?,"If you can give me some advice, please do!"
living like this isn't worth it,
Lost my mojo,
Entering yet another mixed state,"Happens every couple months and it’s incredibly exhausting.  I feel like I’m doing everything right, but just can’t get a handle on any of my thoughts or emotions when it happens.  I feel like I’m a burden to the people around me, and even if they try to help my mind can’t shake the feeling they only care to a point where I don’t terminate.  So I lie and say it’s helping, which exhausts me even more because I have to then act okay too.  Im good about taking my meds, but outside not having daily panic attacks I really don’t feel much change."
I hate sleeping so much…,"I know that it’s necessary…but I absolutely DESPISE it…Even before I was diagnosed, I always hated it and used to do everything I could to stay awake. I was abusing adderall for a while years ago, and I honestly miss how it gave me so much focus and energy and how I could stay up for a couple days on it without getting tired…"
What are some telltale signs you are starting to get hypomanic?,"I think its easy to notice when you’re manic. And when you get manic, you will do everything you can to stay manic (including not taking pills, & increasing alcohol + marijuana use) which usually makes you more manic. But how can you tell that you’re starting to become hypomanic? My psyche mentioned the best way to curtail your manic phase, would be at the beginning of hypomania. But I usually don’t notice I’m hypomanic till Im sleeping 4 hours, talking a mile a min, moving constantly, task switching, and thinking the world is my oyster. My manic phases last 3 months, and I just can’t go through that again."
Always need a vice,"Recently realized that I always need some sort of vice… It’s either some sort of stimulant (nicotine, adderall, caffeine), excessive food cravings, or alcohol. It’s hard to go one day without indulging in one. To be fair tho, I wouldn’t say I’m actually addicted to any of these things. But it’s like a rotation of wanting each one. Sometimes it’s one vice for a week/months, sometimes it’s multiple in one day. Just kinda annoying … wish I could just idk not need something to keep me sane."
Low empathy?,"Does anyone else struggle with low empathy? I’ve noticed that over the years as my bipolar has gotten more serious, my empathy has severely decreased. I was a very empathetic child and teenager but now in my mid-twenties I find myself becoming increasingly unphased by the feelings of other people, even my closest friends. It’s almost like I am acting out compassion as I remember it, but it’s an exhausting effort."
Depressive episode entering the chat,
Is there any point in a neurotransmitter test,"Hey guys, I've felt a bit lost lately and have really been getting worked up about not having a visual or numberal representation of my bipolar brain and was wondering if anyone's had any success or satisfaction from a neurotransmitter test"
Im crushed,"That's it. Today's the day i don't feel like i have the strength anymore, i can't live with all this sorrow within me, i just want to go back, back when things were simple and happiness and stability were around the corner, i can't believe it's been just 4 months, it feels like a lifetime. I can't remember how it is to be at peace when i see her, this pain has become my whole existence."
Control your mind,"Hi guys ;) I am new to this bipolar channel. So I am looking for support and inside. I am diagnosed bipolar 1 year and also I have ocd. I had before other mood disorders, including major depression and schizoaffective disorder. The one common thing how I could manage the latter ones, I could control my mind. And I felt great, meditation helped me a lot. I could decrease medication cause of this. Mainly I could control my depression and mood in particular. Ocd was always on surface. Everything has changed, when I used one medication for other condition and provoked euphoria, irritability, finally to mixed states, till I understood I have no control over my mind. I can't calm it down, nor stop coming mixed states. It was new experience for me and at the same time tragic. I realized that now I am completely dependent of outside forces, like medication. Someone of you guys, with similar experience, you have thought why you can't control your mind anymore, it seems like brain is not reacting to your thoughts anymore ?  Brain don't react to nothing what you think (mind brain connection), its just passive, like autopilot. If you understand, it sounds terrible. My intake, those medication, which caused it irritability and finally bipolar disorder, something changed in my brain. Other explanation I don't have."
Unfeeling,
"Job says they can’t accommodate “that” - Was told it “may not be the place for me,” if I need accommodations for bipolar","I’ve been trying to get accommodations for almost a month now. HR never got back with me, so I took it upon myself to check. The HR lady says “we don’t accommodate that. You said bipolar? Yeah, we don’t accommodate that”"
Birth Control?,"Hi everyone! I used to take the pill form of birth control contraceptive but a doctor told me that it isn’t effective because of my medications (lamotrigene, lithium, trazadone). I currently have the Nexaplanon implant which works well but, caused bad acne, irregular periods, etc. I want to go try something new, any recommendations for people in a similar situation?"
Hey - would love to just chat and discuss how bipolar affects us and the comorbidities that come along with it,"Hey I'm thrushwing,"
Cognitive slowness and functioning,I have been having some noticeable problems with mental functioning and things taking me longer. This is especially a problem at work. I think it’s medication related. I’m on lithium.
Disability advice,I’m 32. I can’t work anymore. Being at work is a constant trigger. I’ve been through countless jobs and have had to quit every one because I can’t handle it. My current job is an easy one but it is still to taxing on my mental health. I have been cycling and I know it’s from stress at work. I can’t pay attention. I have a hard time interacting with customers/ co-workers.
How to sleep?,"I have to take sleeping pills, but my nightmares are so vivid I wake up tired. I've tried not using my phone before bed, but nothing changes. I think im getting hypo: need to fight, even if verbally, overspending, sudden energy and being desperate (idk if it counts but for me it happens). So that doesn't help at all. I feel so much pain and screams and noise in my brain I want to smash it. How to sleep? I need it to get work done. Im feeling like shit"
i'm really scared,"i was diagnosed bipolar 2 a year and a half a go. for a good year i was taking my medication and everything was great. long story short, i started losing trust in my psychiatrist which prompted me to quit my medication cold turkey, i'm very skeptical of talk therapy (likely because i was undiagnosed for so long), and i feel like i'm starting to lose control. i so badly want to be better again but i am just completely overwhelmed now. i don't have the kind of support i had initially had and to be honest i'm kind of embarrassed to ask for help again."
"After months of stabilization, I am once again descending into deep depression. I bought these to help me get through it, and just wanted to share because I have no one else to share with. Thank you",
When did you guys start feeling functional?,Feeling like an 85% normal it’s weird but in a good way to me. I remember when I went off my meds and I started having delusions going crazy having thoughts and wanting to die 2 weeks after this never again. I am a shitshow of my meds. Glad to be mostly normal now.
I'm going to get into bed tonight as usual but I don't think I'm going to be able to get up again.,
Is this hypomania? I can’t tell😅,"(sorry, newly diagnosed with Bipolar I and just trying to figure it all out …)"
"For me, it's the snowball effect ...",I held down a job for 6 months and only have to give notice due to family moving. I stayed the whole two weeks (was struggling emotionally at this job) and they're even throwing a good bye party!
Group therapy?,"How do you lovely people feel about group therapy? Is one on one better? I feel that one on one would be better for me but I keep getting pushed towards group therapy. I’m definitely hesitant. I personally don’t like to share in a group and don’t find that I can pay attention to the skills being taught with other people around. However it’s been a long time since I participated in a group mostly for these reasons, what do you guys think? I would love to know your experiences!"
Are there ways I can drink?,"I recently got diagnosed with bipolar 2, I've been sober for the past month and in a psych ward for the past week. I am planning a trip to go see a friend that moved away and I really want to be able to go out and drink with him. I want to have rules around my substance use so it doesn't get out of hand but am worried that if I say I'll only drink once a week that it will slowly slip. I'm only 20 and the thought of being sober for the rest of my life is both incredibly daunting and nearly impossible. I just want to have fun with my friends but being sober has improved my life so much. What should I do? Are there people that have a rule about only drinking once a week? Does this work?"
How do you deal with hypersexuality?,"I'm coming down from an episode but still hypersexual. Porno, masturbation, and sex is constantly running through my head to the point."
Brain Aneurysm,Hey Everyone. This is mostly a venting post.
Bipolar Teachers?,"Hope I used the correct flair, sorry if I didn’t. Is anyone here a teacher? How do you manage? Do you recommend the line of work for people like us? I’m about to start college with a major in early childhood education and while it’s what I truly want to do, I just hope I can manage it."
What helped your recovery after hospital,"I was in hospital for 5 weeks after a really bad episode and both leading up to being detained and staying there was very traumatising, how did you move on from all that and get back on track with your life any advice?"
Mixed Episode,Does anyone else experience mixed episodes more than either depression or mania?
"Navigating disability is confusing and feels hopeless, need words of wisdom from my Bipolar Bears","Hi everyone. I'm Bipolar and drowning, barely functioning, we all know how it is. I would like to apply for temporary partial disability with me being able to work a small amount of hours. But doing research I don't think I qualify because I don't have a history of long bouts of unemployment. Of course I didn't I have to eat. What choice did I have? I'm really not doing well this year but I've managed to hold on and work part-time, not well but thankfully my boss is very understanding. They say you can get a lawyer but I mean how am I supposed to obtain one with financial troubles? This year, mentally, has been one for the books. I have researched this a thousand times"
I’m in a new relationship and I need advice,The guy I have been talking to for the past few months has asked me to be his girlfriend. I said yes as I really am in love with him. He is aware i have bipolar disorder but that doesn’t deter him at all. I’m on proper medication so I’m stable but I’m scared that one day I might have a relapse and an episode and it will be bad and then i will lose him. Can anyone in a happy relationship and/or in a long term relationship with bipolar disorder give me advice on how to navigate a relationship whilst suffering with this illness? It would be greatly appreciated.
What’s a more positive way to describe my mental stability as “fragile”?,
Can’t hold down a job even on meds,"So exactly like the title says, I literally cannot hold down a job for more than 3-4 months, 6 if I really really force myself. It gets incredibly overwhelming no matter how easy the job is. Does anyone have experience with applying/getting disability for your bipolar disorder? I so desperately wish I could hold a job. I want to work so bad but I can never last more than a few months. I know it’s not me being lazy but I can’t help but feel like a failure. I’m on medication and have been for 5 years but I still can’t hold a job."
Three hours ago I graduated high school,"Like the title says, at 8pm today I graduated high school after repeating for two years."
Bipolar mania/hypomania and face familiarity,Hello!
boss keeps asking me to work on my off days,this is lowkey rant-ish so sorry in advance.
Help with rage,"Having an episode, but instead of straight mania or depression, it's mixed. YAY! The erratic back and forth emotions are mild enough that it's easy to cope with and so far has just been episodic throughout the day instead of constant. It comes out really bad when I get home from work because I'm just so exhausted from keeping it reeled in all day."
Mania?,"Recently I haven't really been sleeping much, but I don't personally think/feel like I'm manic or anything. But it seems like everyone is saying I have slightly more energy and my sister flat out saying I'm manic. So I just asked my mom and she said I'm talkative rn but hey, idk."
I’ve had a very sad thought last night — I think I’m fated to loneliness.,Last night I was thinking of this guy I met last time I was hospitalized.
trying to learn. tips? helpful coping skills?,"first time poster and im struggling a lot right now. I was recently diagnosed as bipolar about a month and half ago. I got started on lamotrigine, and I feel like they've helped a little bit. The only thing is, my moods flip like a light switch. I get so upset that my boyfriend doesn't seem willing to learn with me to understand me better. He just gets upset and goes ""Why are you being like this?"" ""Why are you so angry"" I've gotten to the point where I just go silent and dont say anything to him because I know I can be hurtful. Is anyone else like this? How do I work on this?"
Sometimes I wish people could see it when they looked at me,I'm sure it wouldn't improve things all around. I'm sure some people would avoid me on sight if they could tell. Maybe even some would be violent.
Manic episode,Hey I am manic n I am experiencing euphoria n paranoia n my body can't stop moving n I'm having lots of thoughts of using n some other very impulsive ideas n then some crazy shit in my head think y'all know what I mean Any advice please
Just got out of the hospital,"Just got out of the hospital for the second time. And that was how I got to spend my birthday. I was a bit too open with my therapist, but I genuinely didn't expect to be sent to the psych ward."
If you get an episode at the same time each year,It might be because something traumatic happened at that time of year in your past. I read this in a book about bipolar disorder and I thought it would be useful to share.
Hypersexuality is the worst mania symptom,"It’s just relentless and I hate it. The constant urge to go and make it happen, regardless of whether or not it’s a good idea. Thankfully I can usually control it but it’s unbelievably frustrating. Can’t wait until it’s over."
"Annoyed, unemployed, attempt at side hustle screwed by meds",I figured I'd get into blood donation for money as a side hustle. During the screening process it asks what meds your on and one of them is Depakote that I've been taking the last few months since I was diagnosed.
Bipolar and food aversion,"Does anyone else suffer from terrible appetite suppression and food aversion? No matter what medications I’m on, I can’t stand eating. The smells and look of food make me nauseous. Sometimes I do actually throw up when trying to eat. I force myself to drink a protein shake every morning, and I usually at least try to eat dinner, but I’m not getting enough calories for my lifestyle. It doesn’t seem to matter if I’m stable, manic or depressed, the food aversion remains. I’ve been on 4 different meds since I was diagnosed 8 months ago and each time my doctor says “hopefully as you level out the appetite will improve.” I haven’t experienced an improvement yet. Some drugs have slowed my weight loss, but none have caused me to gain weight or even stop losing. I’ve lost over 50 pounds in the last year or so and I feel weak. I can tell I’m not getting enough to eat, but I don’t know how to stop feeling viscerally disgusted by food."
Has anyone identified a correlation to skin picking and hypomania?,"I’m newly diagnosed with Bipolar II. I’ve always thought I had ADHD, depression, anxiety, and excoriation (skin picking). I’ve been trying to put all the pieces together and wonder if there’s a common thread to bipolar symptoms and skin picking or hair pulling. Seems like a different form of self harm and a subtle way to increase dopamine levels and/or change moods."
AAAAAAAHHHH (Alcohol and relapse prevention),"Its so fucking hard staying on the right path. Every day i have to wake up, get out of bed and not indulge the thoughts at the back of my mind telling me to take the day off and let myself rot."
Music and bipolar,"I’m a very musical person, I’m super sensitive with music and I feel like I associate stages/ moments of my life with music and most of all with songs I’m obsessed with at those specific times of my life. It may be because of my tendency to get obsessed with certain things constantly but that’s the way I’ve been functioning all my life. Recently I found a song that reminds/ makes me feel manic and depressive at the same time. I don’t know how to describe it but the lyrics, the rhythm, every single thing about it is just how I feel as a bipolar person and it makes me feel understood, heard, safe even(? Idk"
Wrote a song while manic.,
hypomania plz help im fucking terrified about this,Idk i need to talk to someone about this shit and i keep bipolar type 2 secret from everyone so. Ive been hypomanic for a week now and sleeping 2hrs a day and its getting stronger and stronger and im starting to scare myself but i dont want it to stop either.
What to expect,"I’ve been on Latuda 20 mg since some time in 2020 I think. My insurance recently decided to stop covering it all of a sudden, and I cannot afford it. I cut my pills in half and tapered myself off of it, taking them every other day. I’ve just recently run out. My psychiatrist suggested I try not replacing it with anything else and just seeing how it goes. Is there anything I need to expect or look for? I like to think I’m fairly self aware when it comes to my mental state, such as when I’m manic, and USUALLY when I’m hallucinating, which I had a history of before Latuda. Thanks"
I think I’m losing my mind.,"I am so angry at the world and everyone close to me lately, I think everyone is out to get me and everyone seems to be doing certain things JUST to piss me off when I am already mad so they can feel bad for themselves or make themselves look good because I loose my temper. My boyfriend tells his mom and brother every-time I have a mental break down or anytime I get overly angry when I’m manic. His brother and us have the same friend group so I know all of our “friends” know about me being “crazy” and they literally make me feel so isolated and uninvolved. My boyfriends mom feels so bad for her son because he’s so stressed out bc of my mental illness that he just can’t make it to work but I still work everyday. No one understands this illness and I feel like i’m purposely being misunderstood so others can benefit off the fact that I am losing all control of my mind. I can see myself slipping but I feel so out of control that I can’t do anything about it. It’s like evil taking over me and the good side of my just helplessly watches while burning the world around me."
Rapid Cycling,"Cycling between hypomania and depression each month is not great. I’ll be hypomanic for maybe 2-3 days, then dip back into some mild to moderate depression for 2-3 weeks. It feels like I’m my best self during hypomania, and I wish that it could be sustainable. I think that job and financial stress is probably contributing to how often my mood is switching."
"Mixed episodes, it's like my skin is on wrong, like my brain is in backwards, I just want to crawl out. OC",
States,
"New doctor didn't believe i was bipolar, i don't take meds anymore because of that, and i am getting weird","EDIT: i took some leftover antipsychotics that previously helped me to stay safe and sane as per the advice of my psychologist, and I'm going to go to another doctor. Just reading y'alls experience really helped me realize what's going on. I'm very thankful for the MOD Team for creating this safe place <3"
Musical experience…,Do you ever listen to music and then you suddenly just ~feel~ it in a different way (like it scratches some part of your brain)? like it takes you to another dimension and you keep on playing the same artist over and over until you realize…
It’s so hard to do what I need to do to stay healthy,"I know what lifestyle changes I need to make; I need to quit nicotine, heavy caffeine consumption and start excercising and meditating properly. It’s just so hard to actually do it! I know my moods would be better but I can’t seem to get my shit together and I hate myself for it. Just a vent really"
Exercise to excessive exercise and self injury pipeline,"I took up exercise to give myself something to do and hopefully release some emotions better. Now I force myself to exercise until I injure my body because I get angry and take it out on myself, but no one thinks I'm hurting myself if it just looks like exercise."
Coming of effexor and abilify,
Am I manic? F17,"Today I had a cold brew, venti cold brew, and two 8.4 fl oz redbull. I thought I was fine but those really made me super energetic and talking fast and wanting to run at work. My manager threw away a redbull saying I didn’t need any more and I broke down into a panic atta k because he crossed boundaries. He bought me another one because he saw how much of a reaction I had. Anyways I didn’t think I was manic but looking back this week , I spent $500 this week) I usually spent $100 every biweekly paycheck), I’ve been having sex like crazy, i lost my virginity and have wanted it badly since then . I went to bed at 12 and didn’t sleep until 2 last night bc my kind wouodnt shut up, my year long goal of moving statss suddenly is a terrible idea and I want to stay here, I drank alcohol right now and I’m feeling stable I guess it cancelled out the caffeine, I bought tickets for a concert this Sunday and I made a new friend and met her family (this is very unusual for ms) but it’s also summer Al i being reasonable or is this mania usuallyim very away about it but i hed the worse cases of mania re where you don’t realize you’re in it also after I left work I got in the car and started screaming my lungs out out of agony and the last time I screamed like that was last year when I was unmedicated exvept right now I’m on lamotrigine but tbh I have been iffy with the times I take the medication or been"
I hate not being able to control my emotions,"Yesterday was my(19F) fiancés(23M) birthday and we both worked so couldn’t do much for him but I was excited to be with him regardless. It was all good up until I picked him up from work and his coworkers and him started talking in the parking lot. I think deep in my head I’m sad about how I don’t have any connections at my job like he does at his. His coworkers are so nice and supportive. But when that happened I just shut down and started to dissociate. I don’t know why because I wasn’t upset or sad about it, the dissociating just started happening. Then when we got home I started freaking out and crying because I couldn’t grasp at any thought in my brain. My mind gets so cloudy and all jumbled so when he tries to calm me down and ask what’s wrong I can’t say anything, no words come out. All I could say is that he should leave me because I’m so crazy and I’m spiraling. I’ve had trouble self sabotaging myself in the past and I was starting to recognize that that was happening but couldn’t say it. I push away when I don’t want to but can’t explain that. Does anyone else have problems like this? I love him a lot and i want this to work but with how I’m acting I’m scared I’m going to fuck it up. He’s so supportive and understanding but I don’t know what to tell him. Because I’m reality I don’t know myself. I haven’t been able to grasp onto a real thought for a while and it’s scary. Are there any tips you have for communicating better or to understand what’s happening with my brain?"
Already 5 years with bipolar disorder,"I’m not diagnosed properly,my illness look like mixed bipolar or schizoaffective,even doctors don’t know the correct  diagnosis ."
I’m worried my marriage is making me worse..,"He can’t support me because he’s almost always in some kind of episode of his own. Over the years he’s been diagnosed with complex PTSD, dissociative identity disorder, major depressive disorder, and now autism spectrum disorder. We grew so much in couples counseling for 3 years until our therapist retired. I’m exhausted thinking about starting up with a new one, but I’ll probably do it anyway. I dedicate so much time and energy to him and his therapy (right now I’m driving him an hour away to do intensive ketamine sessions at his therapist’s house every Saturday) meanwhile I’m white knuckling through my own episodes  and doing nearly all the household work because he can’t. We might have to rehome one of our dogs because he can’t deal with her constant high-pitched barking. I woke up today feeling so sad and hopeless, nevermind neglected. We haven’t had sex in months, and it was barely monthly before that for years. I’m only 41 and I have no social life since we moved to a new state. I had to give up my one close friend here because my hyper sexuality was making me think I was in love with him. I’ll be financially ruined if we split, and I’m honestly concerned he might kill himself. I just don’t know what to do anymore. 😭"
Tried periactin for libido and felt way worse,"Did knew that periactin is a depressant also, took 4mg and it was way overkill, made me feel more depressed a not interested in anything"
Are your episodes mostly triggered by external factors or do they start regardless of any factors?,"If it's been a lot since I had an episode, I start to feel like a water bottle gradually filling up to the top, and the last water drop needed to go through an episode is just any external factor. I feel like I get more and more sensitive until I have an episode, and after that the water bottle is empty so that the whole process can start again. Does that make sense?"
Bipolar 2,"Currently on lamictal, klonopin as needed & lexapro. I’m about to get rid of the lexapro, anyone just raw dog it & use the klonopin as needed? I can’t function with worse anxiety while on an anxiety medication"
Possibility of Type I,"I was talking to my psychiatrist recently about maybe having type II bipolar disorder but my psychiatrist informed me that because I have experienced psychosis before (during what I thought were hypomanias), that makes me more likely to be type I."
Need help concentrating,How do you get through the work day when your brain is buzzzzing and you can’t think of anything?  Also have adhd.
Bipolar / Anxiety,"I’ve fallen into a very great loss, and this also means the people around me are not supporting me. Not being kind - being very harsh and or ignoring me. My anxiety has been very bad lately and I believe long term untreated anxiety - since I was a teen - has caused my major depressive moods. So I was wondering any medications to help treat anxiety while not having the side effect of weight gain and or stopped menstrual cycle!"
Just need to share my feelings about a sibling. We are both bipolar.,
"[High IQ - Asperger with a type 2 bipolar disorder] I have a ""special people"" coach !!!!","It's in the title. I recently filed for an ""official"" disability recognition n showed in on my blog profile."
Do you also have an autoimmune disease?,I saw something recently that said 50% of people with bipolar also have an autoImmune disease. Just wondering if you deal with one on top of bipolar & what it is? I’m honestly not sure if I’d remove bipolar or the disease if given the choice between the two.
I was just curious about something,I was just wondering how many people with bipolar disorder actually take antipsychotics for it. Because I have been for a while and I always feel pressured by my psychiatrist to continue taking it but like it just seems like a lose-lose situation whether I choose to take it or choose not to take it and it doesn't seem like she wants to prescribe me anything else because supposedly I'm doing so well on this medication (invega trinza) but I just feel like I'm wasting my early 30s away and wasted away most of my twenties being on this medication I guess. I don't know Maybe you've heard this rant before. I just feel like I have a lack of energy all the time and I continue to get fat as fuck and there's like this ceiling to how good I can feel. It just feels like I don't take these meds because I want to I'm taking them because of the way the world works around me. I'm just so bored and don't want to do anything anymore. Like I've got no desire to do anything. I'd rather be manic and hate my life. Because right now I'm just like stable I guess and hate my life. Or does this just mean that I need to get a med change? Lol This whole thing's a fucking joke.
Risperdal,My doctor increased my risperdal from 1.5 to 3 to 4.5 in the matter of a week. Now I am left exhausted. I was going manic with mixed features and was going to potentially end up in the hospital. At this point I just feel nothing. I hate the way this makes me feel. I am emotionless. I hope my body adjusts soon. Part of me wants to explore a different medication. I’ve also gained some weight from it already. I am always very hungry. I hope to feel better soon.
Does anyone have experience with this?,I have bipolar I and my depressive episodes are getting worse. I’m already on anti psychotics (abilify) but doctor suggested that we also add anti depressants but only during the depressive episode as it makes my manic episodes worse.
The anxiety though,I slipped up and drank last night.  I wake up so early with heavy bouts of anxiety.  Without alcohol I’m usually depressed.  With alcohol I get anxiety.  There’s always a trade off.
Destabilized by Hormones,"Last Saturday in the middle of the night I started to feel pretty manic out of nowhere. By the morning I was in a full blown mixed mood (not common for me these days). I was aggressive and argumentative but most of all, scared. I find it very difficult to experience depression and (hypo)mania at the same time and I had no idea how long this would last. Then on Monday night I got my period and everything made sense and started to deescalate. I tend to have bad periods with a lot of crying and SI. So I guess my question is, for anyone who experiences anything similar, how do you survive your periods? I can’t take hormonal birth control or antidepressants. I’m running out of ideas."
I just need to vent,I’m falling out of love with my bf. It will hurt. But I want him to find someone else better. I wish him the best but I just don’t trust him and I’m not fit for a relationship at least not in this moment.
Seeking advice/wisdom on how to get through this very hectic period of my life (first post),"M | 28 | Bipolar II w/ heavy anxiety & depression, substance use issues, and (probably) ADHD & mild ASD"
Telling people you're bipolar,Hi there! I see pretty often on this subreddit posts about not telling people you are bipolar. I find this very interesting as I am pretty open about it to relatively anyone I converse with on a regular basis. To me it is simply something that comes up in conversation as almost everything relevant to my life has been traced back to it. After lurking on this subreddit for quite a bit a time I am beginning to doubt whether this is truly the best thing for myself.
Being bipolar is so weird. The mood swings. Jesus.,
Podcast recommendations?,"Coming out of a major depressive downswing, longest to date. The signs of impending hypomania are beginning to show. I'm dealing with imposter syndrome and doing the best i can to make healthy choices. I'm enjoying the brief bouts of contentment but at the same time carefully monitoring myself. I'm so afraid of losing control. It is nice to briefly come out of this debilitating depression I've been drowning in. At the over thinking and researching phase. Managing with just over the counter stuff but thinking medication may be a part of the journey again at some point."
Still manic but aware?,"So I stopped taking my meds because at first I forgot, but now I’m going into a manic episode and I haven’t taken then in about 4-5 days. I’ve gotten pretty good at being able to recognize when I going into either a depressive or manic episode however, I’ve been super aware going into this one which is new for me. So now I’m spending money and doing things I know I shouldn’t because I’m manic but I do it anyways. It’s all new as I was diagnosed at sometime at the beginning of the year but it’s a hellish feeling of knowing I shouldn’t but doing it anyways. Idk if I’m making sense but i hope it does"
Semester is over — scared I'm going to have an episode: Need advice.,"I've been studying at uni nonstop for the last 2 months. I didn't have time to even think, spend time with myself or with my family/friends. It's exciting to know I'm going to have so much spare time to do the things I wasn't able to do, but it's scary. I spent the whole summer only staying in bed and watching videos when I was 13. I'm scared I'm going to do the same, which just sends me into depression. Having too much time alone also sometimes triggers my hypomania. I literally ""attack"" everything around me while trying to kill some time."
I'm struggling.,
"For those with Cyclothymia, how long do your mood swings last?","I tend to notice that sometimes I've had elevated mood for weeks or months and then the depressive episodes can last weeks or months too. Are yours like, lasting a couple of days/weeks/months? Curious."
Too much energy!,"I think I'm going into hypomania and I have way more energy than I know what to do with...so far this time my main energy outlets have been pretty unhealthy (not sleeping and spending way too much). I called my psychiatrist and I'm waiting for him to get back to me. In the meantime, does anyone have any tips for dealing with this energy? I might just run around my house for a while, but I'm also wondering if there are any good non-destructive substitutes to shopping that create the same reward feeling, if that makes any sense. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks."
feeling guilty for using FMLA,"So I’ve been a bit low for the past few weeks and it’s starting to get worse. Yesterday I made it a whole 40 minutes at work before leaving and I’m not going in today. I hate my job it only exacerbates my symptoms so I’m not feeling guilty for leaving them short handed. But when I take advantage of my FMLA, I usually feel somewhat better. Which is kind of the point and it’s not like I’m abusing it just to avoid work. I genuinely feel bad and am having a hard time completing work tasks. But one of my big depressive symptoms is guilt and everything I do just feels like an indictment on myself I hate it. Anyone else feel guilty for using accommodations in a perfectly reasonable way?"
Please help me . Talk to me,
don't want to be manic with a baby,"So my SO and I recently got engaged and unfortunately, his mother immediately jumped into being fixated on grandchildren as opposed to just being excited about the wedding. She's a lovely woman and we have a good relationship but me and my SO are in graduate school in the process of applying to doctorate programs so babies are most definitely out of the question. In addition, we're adamantly childfree since we both have pretty ambitious career goals and know that children aren't the right thing for us. That should be a good enough reason right? Most importantly, I can't become pregnant because my meds don't allow it, when I'm unmedicated things can get really bad for me, and my manic episodes usually get really out of control. (Plus I just don't want to be a mom!!)
I've tried to open up to my MIL about my mental health and my SO who's super supportive has tried to tell her just how important taking care of myself first is and how much my medications have helped me, but she won't listen and she's even going as far to suggest that having a baby would ""fix"" my bipolar because it would make me ""get my shit together"". AND, I've also tried to use my career/school goals as a reason why but instead she came at me with a story about ""this lady she knows"" who took time off from her doctorate program to ""have a couple of babies and start a family"". How do I prove to her that my mental health and my work are of the utmost importance? I'm honestly getting scared. We've had a great relationship up until now and she loves me but I'm starting to worry that what's best for me and my fiance is going to ruin our relationship."
Anybody got any pro tips for dealing with intrusive thoughts and patterns of negative thinking?,I’m looking for the GameFAQs guide on getting my brain to shut the fuck up lmao.
It finally dawned on me,It’s finally dawned on me that I have a genuine disability. Isn’t it wild how stigmatized mental illness is and we’re so often just told to pull ourselves up from our bootstraps?
Hello,"Does anyone take words as anger, or disappointment? Because I work at a burger joint, and sometimes I feel like the manager is unhappy with me. Even though people have told me they are probably only just correcting you, so you can learn how to do the job.  Two of my managers was looking at me, cleaning a table and a few minutes one of them asks why I didn’t clean the baby chair with the right towel (Blue towel = For chairs, White towel = for chair) I’m not always forgetful I just used the white towel to clean the baby chair, on accident."
Just ended my 7th relationship.,"I’m starting to wonder if I will ever be capable of being content in a romantic relationship or if it is always going to feel like it’s never enough. Maybe it’s the bipolar, maybe it’s the bpd. I don’t know anymore. I just feel so lonely."
Good news and a question!,
Moving out for the first time,"I am 23 and I am moving out of my family’s house soon. I’ve been on my own before but I was on drugs and sleeping in my car. Now years later I have a stable job and I am looking at apartments with my friend. Does anyone have any advice or tips? I’m terrified of not being able to manage my money well enough for rent & other bills, or that I’ll start out fine but depression or mania will hit and ruin everything. So I’m very scared but I think it’s time I get some real independence."
hypersexuality?,i don’t know if this is hyper-sexuality but i am horny a lot of the time. its worse when im not stable. i am in an open relationship with my gf and i have a fwb who im pretty close to. the problem is my gf said if i form feelings for someone else that the relationship is over. obviously i don’t wanna lose her but i don’t wanna lose my fwb too cause i really like them.
For the sad days,"Hey BP friends,"
Went to pick up my meds...,"Well, only the lurasidone was there and they told me the lithium had been cancelled.  WTF?  So now I'm here with only the latuda and not lithium. They complain that we don't stay on our meds, but it's such a pain in the butt to even get them.  And it would be ok, but I don't need the lurasidone as that's the one I'm scared to take.  Been actually taking the lithium. I hate this so much."
My bipolar isn't taken seriously because I am 'intelligent' and 'functioning',"I (F25) have bipolar. But because my life isn't in shambles, I am not jobless, I go to university full time while I work full time and am successful at both of those things, I have felt like my (new) psychiatrist has had a hard time helping me."
Making it up?,"Does anyone else wonder sometimes if they have made it all up and aren’t really bipolar? I had a BP 1 diagnosis but I research bipolar a lot and recently I’m wondering if I have learnt the symptoms, and acted/lied on what I know?? Like have I tricked my psychiatrist but knowing enough about the disorder to fake it???"
Can’t get out of bed lately,TRIGGER WARNING: Workplace SA
Hitting a low after mania,"25F I was manic for like a month, probably more idk i lose the concept of time after like 2 days i feel like i can’t get a handle on anything this is the lowest i’ve felt in so long & i just want to get out of this low. i have a toddler, & i’m just so sad cuz i don’t want her to grow up with a crazy mom i love her to pieces & she’s saved me but i’m at this point where i just want to give up everything is going wrong & i just keep asking the world why me"
"I'm An Employer, What Do I Share?","Oh boy! I employ 15 people. What do I disclose to them? I won't burden them by saying I have bipolar, but I feel they need to know something. I've seen others talk about never disclosing to their employers. What happens when you're the employer?"
piggybacking: Longest I've held a job is 10 months.,"Someone recently made a post about having a lot of jobs within a short time frame bc it's really hard to keep them bc of our bipolar. Ever since I got diagnosed and even before then, the longest I have ever held a job was 10 months, and that's only one of the jobs. And it was just weekends. I'm working full time as a vet assistant at a clinic near my house, and I'm terrified I'll do something to F it up soon. I started about a month ago, and my coworkers say I'm doing great and they're proud of me, but they don't know I'm bipolar and it haunts me every day that I could make a mistake where I lose my job. I'm a vet tech student, too, so this is kind of what I wanna do when I grow up. If I lose this job, it'll just look like I was subpar if I put it on a résumé. I'm in a constant state of proud of myself for getting here and also scared to death that I'll lose what I have. Anyone relate? Anyone have advice?"
"That’s it. I’m breaking my lease, cutting my losses and moving back home.","I love where I live, my room, and being independent, but I can’t handle being so fucking broke. It doesn’t matter what budget plan I come up with, my money just slips through the cracks. I bought myself a fucking $50 cat pillow last week that I’ve wanted for forever and I don’t even remember buying it. I’m shit with my money and I’ve racked up 10k in debt and have only managed to, at best, maintain it. I’ll have just enough to cover the fucking $1960 lease cancelling fee, pay for movers to help me move my shit, pay all my bills for the month, gas, and buy my cats food. I don’t care how I feel as I’m obviously just dumb—I’ll just have to suck it up be sad living alone (my parents are overseas) and deal with being scared of the big empty house at night."
guilt,what is it called when someone notices a a symptom and are supportive in response. five mins later that symptom is slowly starting to fade. you feel guilt? what is that?
My meds are making me gain weight and I have the option to switch to something weight neutral. But not sure if the possible side effects would be worth it.,"I have the option to switch antipsychotics to something that’s weight neutral. However, my current antipsychotic Risleridone is working perfectly other than the weight gain. I’ve tried zyprexa, Latuda, abilify, Wellbutrin, Rexulti, Vraylar, Geodon, and Caplyta, all of which had side effects worse than weight gain. My doctor wants me to try Rexulti or Latuda again, but I’m not sure if it’s worth possibly being unstable if they don’t work. On the other hand, the weight gain is definitely causing some body dysmorphia, but I feel like hypo/mania would feel way worse. What would you do if you were in my shoes? Would you take a chance on a medicine change?"
I disclosed to a coworker,We were talking about past jobs we’ve had. I said I had one I really liked years ago but I had a psychotic episode and quit because I felt like I embarrassed myself during that time. He was cool about it. He even told me about how he has racing/intrusive thoughts sometimes and how he copes with them. I don’t talk to my coworkers much so it felt a little weird to open up about that but I’m glad it went ok.
how do you guys keep on going ?,"turn 19 in one week and i’m so tired and so done. working a job that isn’t gonna get me anywhere. coming home feeling dead as fuck. like right now i was just laying on my bed, trying to like re alive myself? im just so tired. have no motivation , no oomph to do anything at all. don’t wanna shower. don’t wanna eat. don’t wanna wake up in the morning. so sick of waking up, working , coming home, feeling so fucking lost and alone. taking meds, then feeling like shit till i force myself to sleep. but i dosed down on meds and went from extended release to fumarate and it feels different now, started taking it earlier because i wake up earlier  and i feel so tired like 30 mins after, feel like i’m  dissociating ? or like on drugs. i feel nothing but stress and agitation, 3 years ago i was doing drugs, having sex, anything to distract myself from my fucjed up mind and life,  and didn’t give a a fuck if i made it to the next day.Now i’m cleaning laundry all day , taking my meds, and realizing i’m just stuck like this forever. just feel stuck. no point, bo place to be, no purpose. Idk how do you guys get that motivation or like feeling of wanting to be apart of this world? and keep doing stuff. i just feel so lost and isolated, can’t find the urge or feeling to do anything"
I don't know how I'm going to do it,"I have an interview tomorrow for a really good full time job that will help relieve a lot of my financial stress, but I have no idea how I'm going to be able to commit to such a job. I've only ever worked part time while I went to school, and even that was a massive struggle for me to clock in more than twenty hours a week. I wish I could work a part time job, but it doesn't look like it's possible in my field. I'm medicated, but it only helps me get to a point where I can actually go to work in the first place, not work full time. I think about how I'm going to have to work forty hours weeks for the rest of my life, and I can't stand the idea. It's not that I hate working, it's that I'm either always manic or depressed, and when I'm the former I want to do anything else but work, and when I'm the latter I'm obviously too tired to get anything done."
I’ve ruined my relationship with my brother because of bipolar and SI,
Quit my job and now I’m depressed,"It was the best job I’ve ever had. It was stressful but it was also stable, work from home, and professional. I get to a point at every job where I lose all interest and get anxiety thinking about interacting with coworkers, even if it’s virtual. I’ve had my fair share of breakdowns and call outs, and I don’t want then to perceive and judge me anymore. Now I feel so lost and don’t know want what to do. My boyfriend is supporting us financially right now until I find something else, but truthfully I don’t want to work at all. I’m sick of this run around time and time again. The same thing will happen in 6 or so months."

Qelbree,Has anyone been diagnosed with BP and ADHD?
Splinters,Lasso the bells off the cattle
After my first big manic episode I just got a BP diagnosis,"Hi everyone, I just got a diagnosis which I did not expect at all and I just don’t know how to feel. I have had multiple depressive episodes with the biggest one happening last September. We ( my psychiatrist, my psychologist and myself ) thought it was a burn out which culminated on an out of nowhere SA. I also have ADHD and was treated both for depression and ADHD. This past weekend I have not slept for 42h straight and I felt amazing. The best I ever felt, super energised, talked for hours without stopping, had amazing sex with my husband while the week before I was super depressed. Today I had my usual psychiatrist appointment and after talking to him about all that, he asked me so questions to evaluate me and told me I just had a manic episode. And that I should stop taking my anti depressants right away. It’s kind of hard knowing what to think. It felt amazing. I don’t know why people would take meds to not feel like this. And this diagnosis has so much stigma especially in my community. I told my husband and my sisters for now but i am still skeptical about the whole thing."
i feel like i’m copying my mother,"i grew up with a bipolar mother who went unmedicated for parts of my childhood, at times i promised myself i’d never be like her. as i’ve grown up, i’ve realized i am an exact copy of her, i just know what not to do. i’m aware of the mistakes she made and i’ve sworn to myself (and her) that i will never make them. still, i can’t help but wonder if i am copying her. maybe there is something else going on and i’m just pretending i am bipolar, like her. the worst part is, i never wanted this. i convinced myself for so long i was just emotional and i just had to get through puberty, but when i did it only got worse."
Disclosing to Employers,"I've seen a lot of posts about when to tell employers or acquaintances about your diagnosis and most seem to say you just shouldn't do it.  I know I'm lucky with where I work now in that they take employee mental health VERY seriously (I work with vulnerable adults which can be very taxing for everyone), but even when I worked as a housekeeper for a hotel I had it down under disabilities.  Here's my reasoning:"
The day has finally come!,I've finally officially been diagnosed with bipolar! Yay(ish)! Comorbidities pending.
What should I do?,"I'm currently living in Australia. Its been four months since I was released from hospital. I am receiving care from a triage of mental health professionals. My medication is paid for, so are all my resources. However I feel a deep sense of anxiety, around using public transportation, using ATM machines and shopping, which is crippling. I feel if I went back to my home country of Sri Lanka some of the anxiety might subside. What should I do?"
How do I combat depression boredom as a part-time college student?,My first semester I was a full-time student. I took three regular semester (15 week) long classes and two half semester classes (7-8 week if I remember correctly) not at the same time for the latter too.
Serpents,
Congratulations I have been ghosted!!,I have been talking with this guy for six months and I considered him one of my best friends. And two days ago he ghosted me. I have sent several text to verify what's wrong but he doesn't reply. I feel super depressed thinking I did something wrong. I'm crying so much because I really appreciate him :((((
A hard day,"I have been in a severe depressive episode since early may. Monday and Tuesday of this week I thought it was clearing up but these past two days have been so hard. It feels like my mind is stuck, and that everyone I interact with either hates me or are angry at me when I can't even find a reason they'd think. During these times I try to keep to myself as much as possible to limit the damage done during an episode. I'm just so tired but I can't sleep which is probably making this all the worse. I wish I could say my mind was in a better place but today is hard. I'm currently on medication and am day 6 of a dose change of lamotrigine which also isn't helping. All I want to do is lay in bed in the dark."
thinking of dropping my engineering degree because of how broken my brain is,"school has always been such a massive stressor for me. my last year of high school nearly killed me, now 1.5yrs into an honours bachelor of engineering, i cant fucking take it anymore. i had the worst year last year, rubber-banding between hypomania and depression, but now, still recovering from a psychotic depressive episode 2 months ago, im not sure how much longer i can do this. notoriously, engineering is such a mind fuck and i go to one of the 'best' engineering unis in my country - that only means it's tough as shit. its so fucking stressful man and it's not going to get any better."
Hi Ren by Ren (Song and Artist),"Forgive my terrible memory but, a while ago someone posted and asked what our favorite songs were that represented our bipolar journey. I didn’t really have one.

What does my doctor mean by “bipolar tendencies”,"I (15M)(transgender) had been dealing with severe depressive episodes since I was 14, but when I turned 15, it started a little different where I went on severe waves like sometimes I would could out and party, do a lot of stupid shit (which is why I’m a addicted to nic at 15) and then unable to get out bad, to the point where my step mom decided I need to go to a mental health urgent care, while there and the psych that I was referred to both said I had “bipolar like tendencies” but not much else. I was put on abilify along side with my Prozac (which I was on before because of severe anxiety) I just want to know what they really mean by that Vs an actual diagnosis. Sorry this probably sounds really stupid but I’ve just been thinking about it a lot for some reason, and I just hope y’all can help me kinda understand what it means"
Help,"Im manic or starting to be and idk how to manage a manic episode. Im 15 and I have Bipolar 1, idk what to do or how to deal with it. It’s a recent diagnosis and while I’m glad to finally have a word for it, I still don’t know how to feel about it."

Tips for mania/hypomania + substance abuse,"I have an alcohol use disorder but only while hypomanic or manic. I binge drink an insane amount, I seem to use it as fuel to keep the mania going. No issues with alcohol while stable or depressed..."
hypomanic,"I’m medicated, and I haven’t had a manic episode in a year. I’m super hyper sexual and very talkative. I’m having really bad racy thoughts and I have so much energy but at the same time I can’t focus. (I have hypothyroidism- pretty sure that’s why) I’m worried that this episode is gonna turn into full blown mania because that’s what always happened in the past. I get bad psychosis when I’m manic. :/"
Anybody on an long-acting injectable Rx?,"Since I have gotten my diagnosis apx 3 years ago, I don't think I've been on meds consistently longer than 2 weeks....spread out over a month. I usually try them out, hate them, and abruptly stop them + ghost my provider for a couple months before I try again. I honestly really suck at taking pills. Ik I need to find the right cocktail buttt I really would like for my BP meds to injected to me so I don't forget to take them or convince myself not to take them :(   .This time of year I usually do a lot of self reflection and I am tired of barely getting by w/o meds. I am just now getting out of a very confusing episode and I don't want to do something next time that I may regret + my friends say I seem better on my meds lol"
What age were you when you were diagnosed?,"I was diagnosed with bipolar at 32 and since I've had psychosis and depression since I was 14, I'm pretty sure I had bipolar earlier than 32."
Just got diagnosed with bp 2 and have some questions,"Hi everyone! After having numerous hypomanic episode and a major depressive episode i was diagnosed with bp 2. Although i dont I have an active episode i have a lot of anhedonia and low motivation but once in a while daily i get very depressed again, crying etc especially when i face my depressive ideas, listen to sad music etc though i dont go as far as the depression from a major depressive episode. Has any of you had this? P.S: Do any of you react violently to SSRI? It was one of them main symptoms for me"
I have not worked in 6 years to be a stay at home mom and just tried to work and got fired,"So I just tried to work, (got a job at a local family establishment as an assistant manager) and was only there for a month. The owner would constantly ask me if I was okay on the meds I was on (he knew I had bipolar II) and I would always feel like I was doing my job okay. He would tell me that I'm not getting it, that I was acting slow, forgetting things, not taking initiative, ect. I tried getting on disability before I applied to this job because before I stopped working, my episodes would prevent me from working when I was working and could never hold a job."
I think i'm hypomanic,"Or at least, i'm getting signs of it. Does anyone know if it's possible to trigger an episode while on meds for bipolar? I think i accidentally did due to stress"
I missed the sky go black yesterday because I was locked inside my psychiatrist's office.,"I wish I saw the sky go black at 2PM yesterday due to the wildfires but I had an appointment with my psychiatrist at the exact same time it happened and I couldn't leave the building to take pictures. I'm tired of having my entire existence revolve around therapy, medications, and hospitaizations. I'm tired of being treated like a prisoner because of a condition I did not ask for. I don't understand why so many doctors have to be so damn creepy like they were bullies in school. I wish I could be a part of a world event like that hut I'm so worried it's never going to happen in my lifetime."
Manic when meeting new people,"This may just be a normal thing, but I can't find any accounts of other people on the internet experiencing this."
Should I inform employers and workers of my bipolar?,"I have trouble holding jobs because of the anxiety and depyand so on. I am currently out of work because I had two anxiety attacks at work that led me to have non epileptic seizures. I had informed my coworkers and bosses of the bipolar. Then all I would hear is are you having a mood or ""we all have depression, anxiety and anger issues"" "" we're all a little bipolar"" makes me so mad hearing these things. I always feel like when I tell people of my disorder that they never take me seriously after that if I have issues or whatever. Anytime I have real normal human emotions they always say it's my bipolar. I've been made fun of and talked down to. Grown adults making fun of me for my disorder.  if I don't explain to people that I have bipolar they'll always say I'm on substances when I'm manic or I'm taking downers if Im depressed. I literally only smoke cigarettes. I feel like it's such a double edged sword."
Feel happier by improving very small things,"I saw a video recently that showed how to make your days different and ""luxurious"" in small ways. I tried it out and it really does help my mood. It provides some extra variety and brings me joy for minimal effort."

How do you forgive yourself,"When you lash out at your loved ones and become a mean ogre. It’s like in the moment that i feel attacked someone else takes over my brain and goes “attack”! When i really want to “cry”! My wonderful husband has forgiven me for my horrible outburst where i was less than kind and gracious. But i don’t know how to forgive myself. I’m still in therapy and on meds and this hasn’t happened in like a year, but it’s still discouraging. :( my poor husband. I don’t deserve him. :((("
Nothing feels like the right thing,"I start doing something (anything) and it feels like I should be doing something else. I start doing something else and I feel like I should be doing... a different something else. The same with where I am; no matter where, it does not feel like the right place. I have all this pent-up, restless energy, but nothing feels like the right way to burn it off. It's so frustrating. I get nothing done. I assume it's part of being of bipolar. It doesn't feel like when I'm hypomanic, but what the hell do I know? Does anyone else experience this?"
panic attacks?,"i've been having what i think are panic attacks, but they feel different than the ones i've had in the past. i used to have them really bad as a kid but they've stopped and i've gone years with only having a few. in the last week i've had two, and i'm not sure why or if they're even panic attacks? i get really uncomfortable and irritated kind of like when i'm hypo, and then it culminates in a burst of rage that immediately turns into uncontrollable sobbing where i can't breathe. there hasn't been a solid cause for this, so i can't figure out what's going on. does anyone else experience panic attacks this way or is it something else?"

Summer Mania,I’m new to bipolar and only had one episode ever however I heard that people tend to get manic in the summer. Any tips on how to prevent this other than staying on meds ?
Is my hypomania starting?,"I recently found out i'm bipolar, but since my diagnosis i never had episodes (it has been just a couple months), i know that in summer mania tends to occur more, and i'm trying to keep an eye on myself, so here's my possible waring signs My libido got more active I either focus very well or feel very understimulated (then again i also have adhd) I am feeling very mildly anxious, worked up and physically energetic"
different types of manic episodes,am i the only person who has different types of manic episodes. sometimes i’m manic to the point that i clean everything and change everything in my life and sometimes i’m manic to the point that i buy random things and do self destructive activities. i’m not sure why it’s like that but i prefer the cleaning one cause at least i feel productive. i feel like being bipolar is hard especially when you can’t control your mania.
I cant increase my anti psychotic without me going into a depressive episode,"Im actually on 2 of them seroquel and latuda. I was on latuda first and as i said i got depressed on it then we went back down and i started getting stupid manic so she put me on seroquel at first one pill and i felt alright and actually good for a bit but started feeling the mania creep up again so i as instructed added another 25mg of seroquel started feeling depressed so i went down again and now im just mute. I used to call my sister every day i havent talked to her in 4 days and have no desire to talk to anyone but my bf. A lot has happened i quit my job, i sleep most of the day, ive slowly been getting my house in order but it just feels endless. I loved going out and now i cant stand putting shoes on. Im almost full blown depressed. I feel like im never gonna get it right. Its been a decade of pill switching and i just want to be stable."
Don’t know what I’m feeling,"Hi, 25 year old bipolar with type one. Putting some of my struggles/thoughts on here. Just kind of need some kindness from the community. I trust and have a lot of support from my girlfriend, family and friends when it comes to my mental health. I just don’t think I have the guts to tell them. I moved about 6 months ago to a bigger city and I knew it was going to be difficult. Change is always super hard for me. I also got into my first queer relationship 2 months after I moved, and that’s been so great but somewhat messy on my part because there’s still a lot of inner work to be done. She also has bipolar 2, and it’s been very nice to have someone who helps me work hard at myself and relationships. I don’t feel judged and it’s so refreshing. Currently on a LOA from my job that makes me super depressed. I’m having a hard time with finding a job that fits me. I cannot handle the stress and wondering if I’m in trouble at work today. I can’t do it anymore. Do you have any suggestions for jobs? Why am I so angry all of the time? Why is it that I feel that if I go in any direction towards something I think would be fulfilling, it’s not worthwhile? I find it inevitable to not slip into the dark mindset. Trying to keep it light has been so exhausting lately and it’s exhausting me to the core. Every time I’m alone I slip into the “maybe you should runaway”, “you should vacation more”, “well you can’t do that because you on only have a broad associate degree and things cost money”, “you could have everything you wanted in life and you’d still be this depressed, should we stop life?”, “break up with your gf, she’s probably mad and you’ll probably end up like all your past relationships”, “hit yourself, you’re pathetic”. Like it just. Won’t. Stop. I’m constantly ridden with worries, sadness, anger. I have hardly felt Any happiness in the last 2 months. Or at least feel like it. I think you understand. I don’t know what to do to get myself out of this rut. I’m starting to go down the path of deleting my social media and going MIA for awhile. I can tell I’m going to spiral again. Someone please help me. Talk to me. Give me advice. I don’t want to hurt myself and/or the special people in my life."
Arguments,Never posted here before but here we go.
Work and Bipolar,Have you ever had a job that you wanted to quit so bad because of your issues? I’m struggling today. I was in a down cycle most of the month and now I’m in a mixed state. I’m struggling at work because I’m irritable and want to cry at the same time. I can’t do either because I have an office full of people (I point that out because it’s not normally like this). If you work full time what do you do to cope? I do better when I’m not with people (sometimes I work from home) but that’s not an option right now.
I'm sad,"I'm just venting here. I met somedays a guy on Bumble, we were talking all day every day, he told me cute things about myself and made me feel happy for a while and told me he was looking all this time for a girl like me. He is not from this country, he is just visiting. And today he tells me he is not coming to my city to see me after he told me he would to. Now I feel depressed and sad because I believed he truly appreciated me and I feel all this chatting and things he said were just lies and a waste of time. He said he will not ghost me when he returns to his country but I know eventually he will specially after telling my diagnosis to him :((((( I hate having such strong feelings for someone I barely knows."
feeling really lonely in my disorder,"it’s so isolating. bipolar disorder is so misconstrued in society and sometimes it feels like no one even has a grasp on what it actually is. it’s so hard to fight to be alive and not hurt others or myself every single day and it feels like no one actually gets that. i love talking to y’all on here because it makes me feel so much less alone, like there are people out there who get it. bipolar disorder is so exhausting. i feel drained all the time because i’m putting so much mental energy into trying to be stable and analyzing my every move and thought. idk i’ve just been feeling really lonely in it recently."
When you miss Mania,I have bipolar one. This assessment was based off of a single manic episode that consisted of delusions and hallucinations. Completely unprecedented. Since I lacked the negative symptoms of Schizophrenia they deduced it was bipolar one.
Icarus,
﻿Stopping my meds due to loss of insurance,"Hi Everyone,"
I need to eat myself to sleep,"I love mornings and I hate nighttime. It’s not so much as I have trouble sleeping, but that I have developed a kind of tiny trauma. This year I’ve had so much difficulty falling asleep, so many unprompted anxiety attacks right before bed, bad “trips”, unexpected insomnia. I fear that as soon as my head hits the pillow, my mind could attack."
Feeling Defeated,I posted earlier in the week about how I was starting to date. I’m a 37 yr old woman and I missed so many years of building relationships due to physical and mental illness. I joined a dating app last week and just had a really bad experience. The guy ended up texting me from a fake number and then started sending inappropriate images. I blocked him on my phone and reported him to the app but I feel really upset and defeated now and like I can’t do this. I was already so scared to start dating again and this really sucks that this was my first experience.
help me cope with feeling of being alone,
I don’t know how I feel?,"I have been pretty stable for a while, yet suddenly I feel off. I am not depressed, and I am not manic. I just don’t feel “well.” I am having to hold back tears for no reason. However, I had an outburst yesterday that resulted in me running out of my house and jumping in my car. All the emotion ran through, and the outburst ended in about 15 minutes. I want to know if others feel “off” or “out of place” in between mood episodes. I just want to be alone, but my family is visiting. I should be working, as well. Any advice is appreciated!"
Committing to my job is hard,"I started working for low pay this past week at a local icecream shop down the street cuz i cant afford to drive anywhere yet. I loved my first day even though I was nervous, my xanax helped me through it. I have called off now for 2 days. I'm supposed to go in today and Iiterally don't want to. Even though I NEEED money. I just don't understand why this has to be so hard to do. I haven't even been there an entire week. I hate this so much why does it have to literally feel like an impossible task idk how to stop feeling like this either. ☹️"
I'm having an episode and nothing is really,Idk what I want to gain from posting this but it helps me to get it out and share with someone who may get it. And I apologize in advance for the cursing.
Thank you,"Thank you, to whoever made this group. I’m currently in a depressive episode & just reading everyone’s posts I don’t feel so alone. That loneliness of not being understood no matter how much you explain, or try to be descriptive. feeling black & white in a color world. & every single thing i feel & do, the mania. i feel so seen & im crying because i’ve been blamed for every fucked up thing having bpd has done to my life & i finally feel like someone sees how hard this shit is & that im trying , not that im not trying hard enough that it’s fucking difficult. right now i feel like i can’t make it but actually reading everyone’s posts helped me a little so thank you praying healing on everyone"
Mania and Panic Attacks,"Does anyone else experience this?  I find when I'm manic my coping strategies for anxiety just go out the window.  Once the anxiety fades I'm still left with that weird manic restless feeling and it's harder to stop ruminating about the source of my anxiety.  I also just have a more intense feeling of panic.  Then when the panic attack subsides I feel I am more manic than before, more out of touch with reality, more restless and full of energy but no where to put it.  I am more confused and it's harder to focus on work that needs doing."
My vape is my security blanket,

I don't know how to do it anymore.,The last month and a half has just been an absolute shit show and I don't know how to deal with it anymore.
Bipolar coming out of Remission?,"Hey there, I'm wondering if anyone has had any similar experience to this I haven't had an episode in over a year, since before I became pregnant. I stopped meds when I found out I was pregnant and haven't been on any since. I'm 7 months postpartum with a wonderful baby. I'm starting to feel something coming, and I guess I'm just conflicted as to whether I should start taking Lamictal again or wait it out and hope it's just from recent stress. It's felt great being in remission, and I almost convinced myself I was miraculously cured from my pregnancy somehow. Wishful thinking haha. Looking for support and hopefully any similar experiences, thank you!"
wishing so bad things were different,
How long do your mood swings/states last?,"Since being on this subreddit, my eyes have been opened to the true variety in length of mood swings with this disorder. I’ve been exposed to clinical facts, and not individual experiences, and it makes me worry that if I have an episode that’s shorter then what’s “clinically accepted” as a manic/hypomanic/depressive episode, then I’m faking, or it wasn’t a real episode, no matter how intense the mood state was. I also have BPD, which effects my emotions, and I can go from having a bipolar manic episode straight to depression because of something someone said to me, be depressed for a day or two, then either go back up, or stay depressed or stable."
Is this common?,
Im deleting this app for a short time,So in order to deal with my anxiety I feel like I have to delete this app for a second. I spend way too much time on it+ I really like the app. There are some genuinly kind people out here and I really appreciate this. But I wanna fix my dopamine craving brain so I have to say good bye.
Struggling,"I was diagnosed with bipolar II in 2020 after a hospital stay. My bipolar has mostly been depression with a very rare and short episode of mania every once in a while. It has been well controlled with meds until recently. I have been having pretty bad mood swings that include longer bouts of mania, which is new to me. I’m talking daily mood swings and insane manic episodes. Nothing extreme but it is uncomfortable because I have racing thoughts and I’m impulsive with spending and I want to talk to everyone about anything that pops into my head but I’m very lonely. I also have no outlets except the gym and I’m trying to take care of a three year old with very little time for myself. I spoke with my psychiatrist last week about changing some dosages on my current medication because I am very hesitant to change medications completely after a very bad experience with a psych many years ago (I had a bad reaction to lamictal, I thought my parents were trying to kill me and they also pulled me off of a medication I had been on for a very long time without titration sending me into withdrawals while also dealing with the side effects from the lamictal) and my main medication helps me sleep. The same hospital stay in was diagnosed bipolar was because I suddenly stopped sleeping and was awake for almost three days and I was having very serious thoughts of self harm, so medication changes scare me because I want to be able to sleep."
Frustrated,"I keep having really intense short turnovers (2 day mania) (5 day depression) and it’s exhausting. The up swings are great because I feel incredibly happy with life and that everything is the way it should be and that I’m “doing the right thing” with my life. The downs make me feel like life is pointless and that I’m wasting my time and energy on pointless things and that I’d be better off d3ad. Having a really hard time regulating and coping, usually I work out the ups by being as productive and creative as possible (art student lol) and in the downs I try to exercise and revisit creature comforts. I’m just really tired of having everything in extremes. Not really sure if I need answers, but I’m taking things one day at a time."
Rescue,I’m so bare
Having both pcos and bipolar,"I'm struggling wirh my weight loss, having pcos, but then my bipolar meds also make it harder for me?? If you're both on meds like lithium and also have pcos, how do you do it??? How do you lose the weight and keep it off???"
Sleeping Problems (Again),"To be honest, I had always have sleeping problems."
"Nothing i do to feel better is working, i keep getting bad news about things i've done to help myself, I can't take it anymore.","Title says it all. I'm doing my best to take care of myself, i eat healthy, i go out, i talk to friends, i'm trying to get therapy but nothing works. I still feel miserable, unwanted, enraged and sad. I already lost my job, gave up my flat in the big city i loved in order to move to my parents' flat because i couldn't bare living alone with my thoughts anymore."
how do i deal with the guilt of existing,"it feels like i hurt people simply by existing. i know that’s not true and i hurt people through my actions and not just by being there, but this disorder feels so uncontrollable it feels like i hurt people just by being alive. i just crashed from a manic episode and feeling extremely guilty and depressed. i fuck up my life and everyone who’s in my life when i’m manic, i pull everyone into my chaos. how do i exist? how do i make friends or get into a relationship when i know that i could hurt them deeply while manic? it feels so selfish to subject people to that. i just want to crawl into a hole and never talk to anyone again because that will protect me and others from my disorder. i’m so fucking sick of living like this. no one understands it either it’s so fucking isolating. im so sick of going on an apology tour after every manic episode and feeling such insane amounts of guilt for things i did. i just want this to fucking stop. bipolar disorder has taken over my entire life and it dictates my every move. does it ever stop????"
being numb,"recently i’ve been fluctuating a lot between mania and depressive episodes. since sunday (it’s wednesday) i’ve had at least one panic attack a day and i’ve been crying nonstop. i hate to say this, but i miss the numb feeling i had after having an episode from before i was medicated. it wouldn’t last long, maybe an hour or two at most, but it always gave me a moment to think, to breathe. i just want to have a moment to breathe, but my own brain won’t let me."
"Close friend passed, having difficulties coping","Hi, one of my best friends recently took their own life. As someone with bipolar disorder and in the process of stabilizing, I’m having a difficult time coping. I do have a good support system so I have been reaching out to family, friends, and my therapist but different emotions have been coming in waves and have been a bit triggering for my mental health. Any recommendations on dealing with something like this? Thanks in advance"
"Not faithful, spiritual, or religious","When I’m medicated, I’m not spiritual at all or even remotely religious. I also don’t have any “good luck” like i did prior to being medicated. Has anyone experienced this? I used to be into tarot, manifestation, good luck, intuition, karma, religion etc until I started lithium . Now, it pains me to even do it because it’s so nonsensical to me and I don’t feel like I have an intuition anymore like i had before."
Weird dream that i had,"I'll get straight to the point; i remembered a dream where i was minding my own business on the phone and suddenly i felt my soul left my body without a warning or a reason. I saw myself in a third person as i watched my body, it started to move by itself. I couldn't move, I could only watch it happen. While I was in shock, that body attacked everything around it-.. That dream was violent as f so i'm not going to go in details.When I was finally able to move, I returned to my body and i managed to stop it on time before something awful happens."
Got diagnosed with PTSD,"Last year my bipolar disorder reared its ugly head and I got diagnosed. I experienced mania, depression, derealization, depersonalization, ideas of reference, suicidality... just about everything."
Sense of self,"Howdy! So, I’ve been struggling with my identity lately. Normally at my core I am unapologetically myself, very genuine and unfiltered when it comes to expressing my thoughts as long as they aren’t hurting anyone. However lately I have been rapidly cycling through extremes. I find myself asking “why did I just say that?” a lot. There’s a part of me that is trying desperately to distance itself from me and Im not sure why. Like I said, at my core Im authentic and I think that that’s respectable but for some reason I’ve really been questioning all of my views on everything lately and cringing at everything I say, it’s starting to feel like I’m getting mental whiplash. I don’t know if this is making sense to anyone else but it’s getting really tiring to feel so ashamed of myself for every little thought. Like, in my head every person on Earth is automatically more inherently worthy and smarter than me (but also I’m actually pretty intelligent, hardworking and not a terrible person…?) and it’s been really getting to me lately. I feel like Im on pause with pursuing anything beyond just getting through the days without having multiple meltdowns because of the narrative in my head that continuously gets disproved yet I continue believing it. And yet, it just do be like that, ya know? Haha, Im just tired I suppose. I also have not been sleeping well for several weeks so I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s just exacerbating my symptoms. Sorry for the ramble. This is the incredibly abbreviated version."
My Personal Theory on Bipolar,"Since my first and hopefully only manic episode, I have reflected substantially on what really sparks these types of episodes. This isn't so much a universal theory of Bipolar but this is kind of how I see it working on my end."
How long did it take you to find medication that works?,"I was diagnosed a little over two months ago and have been on medication since then. However, I haven’t really noticed any major difference in how I feel. Is this normal? Did you notice when your medication started “working”? How long did it take you to find the right medication/dosage?"
Having a really hard time with insomnia,"I’m typing this right now at 5 in the morning after not sleeping since the last night. I’ve had really bad insomnia since my last depressive episode that started around early March and lasted until mid May. I’m in college, so I thought it was the stress but now that I’m in an okay mood again, my bouts of insomnia have not gone away. My psych recommended I up my anxiety/sleeping meds as well as my antipsychotic to help with the depression, but I find that I am still unable to sleep some nights or I’m up until 3-4am."
Feeling perplexed which is leading to defeat,"I am someone who doesn’t want it known to the world I’m challenged in life because of this illness/disease. I don’t consider it a disorder because it impairs me daily. It’s not a sporadic thing. I work so hard to do my best but during high times of stress, when my diet is off, my sleep is off, overwhelmed, sad, life events etc a different reaction occurs. I don’t know a normal baseline, I am either high or I am low. Meds keep me mellow for the most part but I hate being stuck at a job I hate that has benefits so I can support my disease. It’s not enjoyable for me. My family has suffered a lot. I co parent with my ex but when I say coparent I mean he takes his kids during his access. They come home miserable and tell me they sat in the house all day and slept or they watched movies. Everything is left up to me including appointments and  all activities and fun. I’m being forced now to provide a letter by a dr to provide; list of diagnoses, treatment plan, medication list, therapy regiments, supports and any care I have refused. I think this is against my human rights. If I don’t provide this list, which will be made public, the world will know and I will forever be labelled. I will face ‘severe consequences’. My privacy will no longer be mine and my power of privacy will be gone. Am I wrong to not comply? I would rather lose everything than provide that drs list"

I’ve been off this medication recently trying to work on other ones. Nothing ever comes close to working as good as Zyprexa. It really helps with my sleep and mood during the day. I don’t think I can find anything else that works that way. If I’m not on Zyprexa and another medication I wake up at all times during the night. I have a sleep disorder. Has anybody taking it long-term?
Today is the day I give up drinking,Title pretty much sums it up. I have a drinking problem that I’ve been ignoring for awhile now. I want to be better for myself and family. I know I’m gonna feel so much better in the long run giving up drinking
i’m getting disability! because i got dis ability to succeed,"but jokes aside, this is a win! i’ll have excused absences in the event that an episode or doctor’s appointment causes me to miss school. my grad program has a policy where a certain number of absences normally drops your grade, so i’m really relieved!"
Have you ever had a hurtful reaction when sharing your diagnoses with someone new?,"Several years ago I started a job that I was really excited about. I was getting to know my coworkers and there was one in particular that I really vibed with. We hung out outside of work often, painting and making art together, and we were really getting along. I thought that she was super cool, and I was proud that she was my friend. I thought she liked me too."
Do you ever think about just stopping all meds?,Do you ever wonder if maybe it’s the wrong thing to be taking all of the meds? Maybe if I just stopped all of them I would stop feeling like crap and would just be normal? I’m currently on mood stabiliser + atypical antipsychotic + beta blocker + stimulant. I’ve been on some form of med since I was 17 (many years on SSRI’s or SNRI or SSRI + antipsychotic)
Job Interview Today,Got my first job interview in years today.  Ngl I'm absolutely terrified.  My brain fog has been pretty bad recently.  My lithium increase has been giving me a really bad headache and I only got about 5 hours sleep so I'm trying to be kind to myself.  I know if I don't get it nothing changes if I don't get it but at the same time I've been unemployed for a while now and it would be nice to be back earning money again.  Please send me good vibes.  :)
Do you have any other diagnoses other then being Bipolar?,"I’ve been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 for about 5 years now. And over the years I was recently diagnosed with Anxiety, OCD, PTSD, and in past years I had an eating disorder. I’m just curious as too if it’s normal to have so many other diagnoses fallowing with Bipolar. Or I’m a just weird having all these diagnoses lol"
Bipolar people IRL,Do you spend time with bipolar people on a regular basis? Like a support group or friends or family? And how do you feel about having (or not having) other bipolar people in your life?
I feel like there's nothing I can do about my depression boredom,I lost interest in my hobbies during these last six weeks.
Sometimes I go into complete panic / confusion / dysfunction for hours at a time when stressed (?),"Hi everyone, I have bipolar 1 and have trauma. For the past 6 years or so, I’ve noticed a pattern which I’ve been calling “dissociation episodes”. Sometimes there’s an obvious trigger, and sometimes not at all. When these happen, it’s like I’m panicking and filled with doom and worry, but I also don’t feel like myself at all, it feels like I’m dead inside, I can’t work, I have trouble understanding anything. How I feel better is by taking some seroquel and sleeping. When I wake up I’m back to normal."
How do you stay hopeful?,"I've been dealing with mental illness for almost 9 years now. I've been diagnosed for over three. That latter period has been living at home, working small jobs and trying not to get fired, and talking with my two friends. I refuse to believe that I've made no progress. I'm part of a D & D group, I don't apologize constantly anymore, I'm working a full-time (ish) job. Ecetera. My intrusive thoughts are a lot quieter."
I’m bored,I have been labeled as ‘partial remission’ whatever that means. I have been considered stable for over a year now after getting sober and having my kids. I thought I would love it. I have two great kids and I love being their mom but I am bored out of my mind. I catch myself all day thinking about how my life used to be. I did a lot of risky behavior with men in my past and was drinking daily for years. I look back on it and miss it. I miss feeling manic at times. I miss the comfort of my depressive times. I love how I feel but oh my god I want excitement like that again. Am I the only one?
Don't know what to do,"Let me start by saying it's been a hell of a month. Actually a little longer, but I digress. At the end of May, I was fired from my last job because they found out I was looking for a new job as they had just cut my pay in half and demoted me for ""having too many ups and downs"". At the time I thought I had another job lined up but for one reason or another they went in a different direction. I started drinking even more heavily than usual and was drunk every night for about a week and a half. That ended with me saying some horrible things to my wife and mother, and some extreme psychotic depression. I haven't had a drink since and plan on never drinking again. During the days I was looking for a new job and applying for unemployment, which I did eventually get, and I also eventually got hired for a maintenance position with Amazon, as they are building a new fulfillment center just outside my home town. My first day was slated for June 5th, and I spent alot of time with my wife and son trying to repair the damage I did. I'd like to think things got better over the next few weeks after my bad episode. Fast forward to the last week of May, and my recruiter emails me informing me that I would be flying to Nashville for my first week of training, all paid for, thankfully, including flight, rental car, and hotel. I had my first day of training today, and it was pretty uneventful. But I'm up late now, and need to work at 7:45 tomorrow morning, it being 1:20 am now. I just can't sleep. I'm so full of self doubt and a deep achey sadness in my gut that just won't subside. And I'm so incredibly lonely. I miss my home, and I can't sleep and I somehow have to function tomorrow. I dont know what to do, I've got no one to talk to. I feel like I'm slowly spiraling before I get swept up into the event horizon of this cataclysmic black hole and it just couldn't happen at a worse time."
i signed myself up for summer school for no reason while manic,"i’m in high school. i have all my credits that i need so far and i have no reason to take summer school, but i signed myself up for it—in my least favorite subject—during a manic episode because i decided i’m going to become a super good student, boost my gpa as much as i can, and get more credits than i need and go to a good college and get rich. it took me less than 5 minutes to decide this, change my opinion about the subject i signed myself up for, and then i signed myself up. now i can’t unenroll and i have to do it. i don’t get a summer break anymore i guess"
I'm manic,"Like the title says, I'm manic. In the past 2 weeks I've spent approximately $2700 on credit cards that I am only supposed to use ONLY in case of emergencies. I only make 80k a year and have 3 kids 2700 is ASTRONOMICAL to me. I stole from my job twice in one week like 400$worth of things(an air conditioner and a yeti cup). I've not stolen since I was a child. I lied to my husband about it so I wouldn't have to hear a lecture. I don't feel guilty about either yet, infact I felt a rush that was great. I know when I come down from this episode I'm going to feel AWFUL but I don't now 💁 I see my psychiatrist on the 8th but I messaged him last night because a close friend of mine told me I really should. He hasn't responded yet, and really truly, I don't know what he's going to even do about it. I've never been self-aware during a manic episode like this. It's as if I'm watching myself. I'm doing all of these things and I know in my heart that I should be upset about it and not okay with it but I really just don't give a fuck and am enjoying it. Like pfft, that's tomorrow's problem."
"CHECK-IN WEDNESDAY ✅- June 07, 2023",How are you feeling so far this week? Let us know how you're doing.
What is it with art and being Bipolar?,"Hi, new here, i hopped on this page cause i have been recently diagnosed and im desperate, but that's in my other posts. Anyway, guess what?? Im an art student. The most upvoted post? A painting Everyone here likes sketching and drawing. People make collages. Is there a connection between being bipolar and art?? I mean i know a lot of artists are troubled people but i didn't think ALL OF THEM"
I was 13 years old when I learned recurring suicidal ideation is not normal.,
Am I just faking it,"I'm starting to think my psych doesn't believe I'm bipolar and at first it made me so mad but, what if it's true?"
Trouble with Routine,"So, I’ve been trying for what feels like years to get myself to stick to a daily routine. That’s what all of my doctors and therapists over the years have told me would be the best thing i could do to manage my episodes. The question is, how do I do that? I feel like I always come up with some really enticing routine and get so excited about doing it every day, even when it’s very simple basic tasks. I can’t make myself stick to it. I’ll do it for a few days, maybe even a week, then it’s like I never even tried. I’ve bought habit trackers, planners, tried journaling. I just can’t make myself do the things that I know are best for me no matter how badly I want to. I guess I’m just asking if anyone else here deals with this same issue and how you deal with it."
I'm a teacher and I have to leave my job because of this sickness,"I've been a middle school teacher for almost 5 years now. I love(d) my job. But this illness has made it SO complicated. Yesterday I had a full psychotic blow up during class and started to throw pens at my students, yelling nonsense, and destroying stuff in my classroom. When I came back to my senses I decided that I couldn't possibly continue; I'm still shaking thinking how I could have hurt my students and how frightened they must have been seeing their teacher act like that. I'm glad other adults came and helped me and the kids, but the whole deal is horrible. I felt like I was an animal, as if something had taken control of my body... I have never had psychosis before (at least I think so?). And it feels horrible."
Acceptance,"I was diagnosed with bipolar ll 8 years ago, I have fought it for years and refused to believe it. I was diagnosed again 4 years ago, still refused to believe it. Worked against it and unintentionally made it even worse by lashing out. I was just diagnosed again this year, and my initial response was the same as always. They must be wrong about me, I'm not bipolar and I refuse to ever believe that. I didn't lash out this time though. I just grieved and mourned on my own. I grieved everything I could've been if I was well. Now I'm on a mission of acceptance, because it's either that or I wallow forever and live my life in bitterness and jealousy of those who aren't bipolar. I'm just sharing this because i'm not sure anybody in my real life cares to hear it. I'm thinking of getting a tattoo, to really start my journey to acceptance. I want to get comedy/tragedy masks, because as well as being bipolar I'm also a huge Mötley Crüe fan."
"Newly diagnosed, sleep problems and unsure about doctor","Hey reddit,"
how do you deal with anger issues/irritability?,"Long story short I have a short fuse and very little patience. My boyfriend is the sweetest person I know. He's the most loving, considerate, and thoughtful man you'll ever meet. I love him with every fiber of my being and want to marry him one day."
"Folks with bipolar, did you have to adjust to your medicated self?/How did your lifestyle change once you got on medication?","I am 21F, diagnosed bipolar I a year ago, but I have had symptoms since late childhood/early teens. Before adulthood I experienced typical and awful bouts of depression, where I got barely anything done and was able to do well in school just by being a smart slacker, interspersed with periods of (hypo)mania where I would sleep much less, feel euphoric and productive, and get a fuck ton done... even as a teen I'd feel so inspired/creative and in my own head that I'd write heaps, some of which became national prize-winning stuff, or published work. So I kind of fell into this cycle of doing absolutely nothing when depressed and then just waiting for the mania/hypomania to kick in so that I could rapidly catch up on everything and be my ""normal"" self, frontloading work and accomplishments before the depression inevitably hit again."
Recently diagnosed,I (f17) recently got diagnosed with bipolar and it scares the absolute shit out of me I feel as if the diagnosis went over my mums head. I feel as if no one is taking me seriously. It makes wanna tear my skin. I'm starting abilify but I'm scared that I'll get worse instead of better.
My mom prays for my bipolar to go away.,"My mother tells me quite often that she prays for my bipolar to go away .  Like its sweet and i am a religious person myself but i dont think prayer will ""cure"" me. She hasnt asked me but i am wondering if she is gonna ask me to come off my meds to see if her prayers work. She says she prays every night for me and for it to be healed. She thinks since i havent had an episode in two years that i am cured but its just my medicine keeping me stable. Like i said a appreciate what she is doing but i feel like its wasted."
Too afraid to start a new relationship after name calling and emotional abuse.,"I regret sharing my diagnosis with my now ex. All of a sudden, it became commonplace for me to be the ""psycho"" and ""crazy"" person all because of my diagnosis and that gave him the ""power"" to abuse me even more. I feel like a fool, maybe I really am. I have absolutely no self confidence now and I have no hope for humanity. Has anyone else been through the ringer with an abusive partner and never thought you'd see the light? I hate that having this disorder makes me dwell and fixate on the worst things about a person I love even though a part of me wants to think otherwise. Sorry, I'm all over the place but I have no one right now and I think that's what best. Most people just try to take advantage of me and I don't even know what or who I am anymore. I've given up on trying to talk to new people because I just scare them off. I'm just a joke and I can't help but feel like even my therapist is sick and tired of me talking about the same exact thing, every single session. I'm absolutely sick of people telling me to just get up and go on and to find my worth. I'm afraid at such a young age, I'm deep in the pits and can never get out. I'm not even trying to get attention or wanting a permanent solution.. I'm just used to the monotony of hating myself and wanting things to go back with this horrible person."
Does it get any better?,"I’m so sick of feeling on top of the world and like I can do anything to thinking I’m ugly, useless piece of shit."
I found an hour and a half of peace,
Well. Shit,I have a busy day planned today with appointments and stuff to do. I said I'd be asleep early this time. In Dreamland no later than 2am
Depressive Episode - Same time every year,
Off of lamotrigine for 4 days,EDIT: spoke to psych and already feeling better after my dosage today. shit was crazy lmao. never felt less real
being woken up in the wrong way,
If Given The Choice Would You Be Bipolar?,"Someone was telling me they recently saw a documentary from an actor who asked people if they were given the choice to be born with or without bipolar they would choose to still be bipolar. I know nothing about the sample size, stage of diagnosis or type of bipolar but I find it interesting. I know there is strength in pain but if I could choose to have not hurt my family and so many others and live a normal life I think I would not want to be bipolar even if I was diagnosed early enough to have not suffered as much."
I have a fear of getting another serious illness,"I’ve been thinking about this lately. I do have some health anxiety that started about a year ago and it was cancer related for some reason. I am going for a check up soon that I’ve been avoiding for three years. I’m sure everything will be fine, but that health anxiety keeps asking “what if…?” I seriously cannot imagine having this disorder and cancer. Ahhh"
Break up,"I am about 18 months out of a 20 year relationship, I never worked it out but recently got diagnosed as bipolar type 2 with rapid cycling.  It makes so much sense now and the meds have changed my thinking and clarity a lot."
How to deal with a depressive episode?,
coming off a manic episode and med changes,"I'm (f21) on 8mg abilify, 50mg pristiq, and recently 25mg seroquel. It's also worth noting I'm on Yamin birth control as well."
Concrete,All is plenty in nothing
Can’t stop hating myself… 😕,I have been the cause of so many problems in my life and I cannot take it anymore.
Career loss,How do you lovely people cope with job loss and career loss as a result of your bipolar. Specifically in my case where I lost jobs and had to give my career up as I was undiagnosed at the time and my behaviours resulted in the job loss. I've looked back at the last 15 years of my life at least that appear to have been affected by this illness and I just didn't know. Noone took me to one side and said maybe I should get this looked at. They were very quick to recognise the depression but didn't saying anything about the manic or hypomanic behaviours
just got diagnosed… what do I expect? I’m sort of bamboozled,"Went in for my adult ADHD assessment today - I left with not only a diagnoses for that, but I was also diagnosed with Bipolar. The psychiatrist I spoke to told me since I meet the diagnostic criteria for Bipolar, I will need to start a mood stabilizer first before proceeding on with ADHD medication."
Does it get worse? I heard it was degenerative but come on...,For context I was diagnosed when I was around 17. It was rough then but after a few years of therapy and more med changes than I can count I hit an incredible streak of normalcy and productivity. Sure things were hard sometimes but damn I had it together.
I'm thinking about going back to college,"I really want to go back to university. I don't have any medications, and I probably won't for a long time. I don't want anyone to tell me I can't right now, I already gave doubts myself, but I really want to get my bachelor's in psychology. After I'll go for probably my masters, or my doctorates I'll figure that out later. I'm really excited, but I'm also pretty sure I'm manic. However, my want for psychology degree is something I pick back up everytime I'm manic, along with random other degrees, but always psychology. I'm just wondering if there is any advice or support y'all can offer, because university is a big ask and something I continue to struggle with."
How do you make peace with being dulled out?,Today I fought internally over whether to take or not take my Vraylar. I’ve been on it for maybe? six weeks? I honestly can’t tell.
"trying to look around, but everything feels like static noise",
"I think that I have a level head, but the hallucinations have gotten too real and they are about to completely ruin my life. Any suggestions?","I finally found out what is happening to me — a few weeks ago. I’m rapid cycling and having 3 day spurts of hypo-mania and awful hallucinations, I try to convince myself that they aren’t real but they can be so overwhelming. They are happening too often and I’m about to lose my relationship with my Mom and my Job. The only 2 consistently good things in my life. But there is no way in hell I can go to work like that. I also start having panic inducing hallucinations when I try to go to sleep. I’ll be on the brink of sleep and I’ll hear somebody screaming or pounding at my door. It sends me into a full panic and I just give up on sleeping. They are seriously so scary. I’ll just stay up until my body gives out. What should I do?"
Episodes lengths,Hey guys! Curious how long episodes last for you guys. I seem to go from depression to hypomania every 4 months or so. I usually gradually go from depression to hypomania. But usually snap from hypomania right into depression. What about you?
I can't live like this anymore,"I'm so tired and exhausted. My arms are sore from sh, and I physically cannot live without a romantic partner. It's the only thing filling the empty hole, and my reason to live. I recently went through a break up and began feeling suicidal, and then I met a new guy who rejected me. I feel so unlovable."
Is there therapy for someone traumatized by dealing with their illness alone?,"I have seen many therapists and I feel it can help but always grinds to a halt when talking about trauma. My outside life has been pretty good. I have good relationships with my family, mostly stable romantic relationships throughout my life, barely any kind of bullying growing up, a great marriage, friendsn education, talents, financial security, most people seem to like me..."
Lamictal is driving me crazy,
a small comic about my bipolar. originally posted on another sub.,
Friend told me I should get off my meds,"I haven’t talked to friend in years. We shared our mental health struggles and I talked about my medications for bipolar + anxiety(lithium, ziprasidone, lamotrigine, lorazepam) and he told me I need to get off them and go on Seroquel and an antidepressant lol. So annoying. Also said I need to start fasting."
How can i cope with having lost it all?,"I lost my gf and friends in a manic episode and spend my days crying, i just want to be ok, im afraid that all this emotional stress could trigger more episodes, help, im afraid"
Happy Pride! Everyone of you is loved!,
Does anyone experience this,Recently been diagnosed bipolar and I just wanted to see if it's common for people to feel like a buzzing/ringing in your ear sound like tinnitus when they are in manic or hypomanic states?
I’m so bitter towards myself,"woke up this morning after about a week of falling into a mini depression (compared to how it used to get without my medication.) Im out of pot and I finished my last cigarette yesterday morning. I told myself im done smoking anything because my brain just wants to do that all day when im depressed. I also binge eat and gain like 20 pounds when I smoke pot and am depressed. Once im over the low spells, I quickly try to loose the weight and do so successfully in about a month in a half."
Passing my exams,Hey everyone!
What to do about rage,This always happens and I feel like a toddler posting this because it seems so fucking stupid but I cannot control my rage at all. I yell I hit things I throw things I plan in my head to kill whoever I think Is doing whatever they did that made me upset and I pace a lot and I cut a lot to prove that everyone’s just pathetic and I can’t feel it and that I’m better and I make plans to leave and I do and I always pace around and I’m so angry and feel so on top like I’m gonna kill them. Idrk it’s weird but I seriously can’t control it and my behavioral health person has given me strategies but I can’t do that or think of that in that moment obviously and they say to have someone remind me but that would just set me off more because they think I’m being irrational which i obviously am but I don’t see that then. This happened recently and idk why but I still think that whoever made me mad did it on purpose to fuck with me to get me to have a reaction like this for their own fun or to get me into a hospital and it makes me feel upset but not nearly as upset but still upset
I don’t know what to do,"I just finished my undergrad in uni and finally have the time for myself more than I have. It’s time that I find a full time job and start working, as well as slowly looking at masters programs. I barely even made it through university and can’t even believe that I’m here as sad as it sounds.. but I’m sure many of you can understand. I have no motivation to work now and have been unemployed for a bit. My depression has jsut been so bad, and I can’t even fathom working a 9-5, it’s something I never wanted to do. But I also know once I get a job I am going to regret the time I’ve had for myself. I don’t know what to do."
Whats the closest to being manic without being manic?,
Positivity/motivation comments gather here! <3,"hi people i just wanted to say that i have turned my life around lately even though i’ve been super depressed. Once you realize what part is your disease and what is your personality, life gets much more logical."
Antipsychotics & FMLA. Please help.,"So, I've been on Lamictal for a while. It wasn't really doing much for me and eventually the increase in dosage was causing confusion, memory lapses and heavy brain fog. This nearly landed me in trouble at work, luckily I opened up to my supervisor about what was going on and he was more than understanding of my situation. Well, my psychiatrist wants to have me try antipsychotics, considering my symptoms have also been a bit out of my control lately. I'm fine with trying out the medication, I'll do whatever helps me. So, to the point. I work with heavy machinery and I'll be jumping into a sixty hour work week while getting started on antipsychotics. Should I use FMLA for this week to see how I react to the new medication or? Has anyone had impairing side effects at the beginning of a new treatment plan? I haven't used my FMLA for this yet, but it's there to use. I really hate to take off work and I don't want it to look like I'm abusing FMLA right off the bat."
Paranoia and how you cope,Hey everyone!
Do delusional thoughts ever really stop?,"24/M diagnosed 3 years ago after my first manic episode. I stopped taking the medication after a year and moved in with my girlfriend. Everything was fine for a while but in January I had a gut feeling she was cheating on me. I couldn't ignore it, I checked her phone and found texts with her boss..they were all very normal texts and nothing concerning at all. but in my mind they were confirmation of cheating. I freaked out and scared her really bad..I had to go back on abilify and lithium. I've been back on it for 16 weeks now but I still can't stop thinking that she is cheating on me, even though she stayed with me and forgave me for what I put her through. it's like one part of my mind says no this is wrong, stop. And the other 90% of my brain is obsessed and constantly desperate to confront her about it, constantly angry..I'm in therapy but the coping methods don't seem to help this and I'm scared to increase dose because the side effects are rough..but I don't want to ruin the relationship I have..thoughts? I just want this to stop :("
Coming off Lamictal?,Has anyone tapered off lamictal before? Did you find it challenging? I am dying over here with it. So frustrating to feel poorly for like two months of tapering. I’m losing it! Am I supposed to feel this tired? Any advice? (was on it for 5+ years)
I feel ashamed,"Yesterday I was in a huge depressive state after three days without anything, I started crying for hours and feeling like if I was in jail, I felt stupid and useless and when a friend talked to me on WhatsApp I started complaining and saying that life was useless...now that I'm feeling better I feel more than ashamed, I feel ridiculous for thinking this way"
How do you know it’s the bipolar?,"If you have more diagnoses like me, (cptsd, ocd, adhd, Ed, bpd) how do you know when you’re in an episode or if it’s a bout of emotional dysregulation? I feel invalidated in all of my diagnoses cuz I’m not sure which diagnoses is shining per say. I just want to feel validated."
My marriage anniversary,Today is the day that marks 14 years of marriage to my wife. I no longer have my old friends but I have acquired some new ones as my interests have changed. My wife has been with me for 20 years now. We met in the basement of church. It was AA. I was 2 years sober when we met. She helped me clean up my life and supports me as a friend would. She stuck with me through 2 psychosis episodes that landed me in the hospital. All while she was nurturing our little man. Just a shout out that I’m still in love with her. Taking in the good memories today.
I'm sick of my meds,"sorry this is going to be a short rant, so if you don't want to read it please keep scrolling."
Newly Diagnosed,Hi I’m new to this page and to being diagnosed with Bipolar 1. I’m having some trouble understanding the difference between hypomania and mania. I’ve done some quick research but I usually have trouble understanding things with mental health when it’s from a clinical definition. If any of y’all would be willing to help with descriptions of mania/hypomania I would really appreciate it. I’m trying to process this all and it’s rough when I don’t even understand🥴
Teddy keeping me company,
Does anyones mood cycle extremely fast and constantly?,"I take lamictal, venlafaxine (Effexor), concerta, and buspiron every day and they’ve helped significantly. Every day I lived before these medications was torture and I am a completely different person now. But, my moods have always cycled so fast. For a couple days I’m down in the dumps, drinking, binge eating, depressed, anxious, etc. Then I have a couple day spurt of energy and happiness and hope until it all cycles again. It’s absolutely exhausting and I hate knowing that my happiness will only last a couple days. Anyone else experience this?"
Depression poem,"Rainclouds over me I’m seeking deeper. “I’ll never stop fighting” I say, As I nearly give up."
This illenss made me lose my girlfriend and i cannot live like this,"It was all fine, we had a 2 and a half year long relationship, and i was taking adhd meds, up until it happened. I did not know i was also bipolar.. strattera worsened my first ever manic episode, i left her for a person i barely know, after a month and a half i came back, she forgave me, she helped me realize im also bipolar, but all the love in her is gone, and she cannot give me my girlfriend back, my heart is broken and i never felt so alone, this is so unfair! After all i tried to give her i ruined it all myself!! I know that technically it isn't my fault but i can't help but blame myself, i also realized i have even fewer friends than i thought so this summer is shaping up to be the worst, loneliest shitshow of my life, i am so fucking destroyed."
Gaslighting myself: mania,When I’m manic I can kind of recognize it now but it’s extremely confusing because I’m like “no I feel NORMAL.” Like yes I spent $90 on clothes when I have payments to make and yes I scheduled a haircut for tomorrow without thinking but that’s just normal impulsive things.
Is it only me or?,"I don't know if this has to do with bipolar disorder or something else, its just something that always bothered me and the people around me as well.I noticed that i always had moments where i couldn't control my speech.Like once i start talking,i just can't shut the hell up (Like right now lol).So most of the time i will force myself to be reaaaally quiet even for no reason so i don't end up bothering or hurting someone with my bs.Every time i do that, those who noticed i stopped talking end up being concerned about me.Its annoying tbh. I noticed that majority of people told me that ""i'm crazy"", ""i'm speaking nonsense"", ""i'm impossible to be around"", ""i'm annoying"" and  ""loud"".There's more but these are common i heard. What's more concerning is that if you try to stop me and if you are being aggressive to me i will start a fight and go to the extremes. It can be sometimes violent and it can be sometimes something harmless.It depends.If you want to calm me down you either have to be patient with me or gentle.Sometimes that will not work.I can be very unpredictable with it. So this is why i most of the time isolate from everyone.They don't have the energy to be around me so they avoid me like i avoid them lol. 50/50.It is not helpful either if i'm fully alone or lonely. I will probably be suicidal, drunk, idk it really depends, i'm very random so you never know what i'll do next.But yeah i can't control myself at all.Am i alone with this struggle or? - (sorry for my bad english)"
Depakote- managing weight,
The End or New Beginning?,"I don’t know why I’m posting this but here goes, I have nobody to talk or turn to in this life seems like everyday little pieces of my life fall apart no matter how much i try to keep them together and the harder i try the more it falls apart, and all bc of my brain!"
I feel hopeless,"Sucked into the black hole of too emotions. I gave up my apartment I lived in the last 8 years- the last 5 of them on my own, so my parents could take over and I moved in with my boyfriend of 5 years. I was stable for a long time but now I’m here, in his shared apartment, in a terrible place mentally and he isn’t prepared for it. I’m worried this strain might tear us apart and I’ll wind up living out of my car like I was prior to finding my little apartment. I miss my home."
Post mania shame,"I was extremely manic and engaged in actions that I am not proud of. I’ve did it all; I’ve threw away my virginity to a stranger, did so many types of drugs and almost drank myself to death, I’ve did SW. and I failed the semester and participated in the must unsafe and wild sexual acts you can come up with. I’ve put myself in dangerous situations that made me get even more hurt and abused."
thirst due to medications,"my medication makes me so goddamn thirsty, every moment I'm not drinking it feels like I haven't had water for days, my mouth is so dry yet I'm salivating so much, its like a mixed episode is happening in my mouth, how does everyone else cope with this thirstiness"
Everything is boring,I'm in the process of getting tested for ADHD.
"Why are my episodes always mixed, now?",
I feel bad,
Today I threw my weed pen out,
I'm such an annoying person,I'm tired of my emotions. I'm manic or hyper depressed or hyper grumpy. I feel embarassed of what I say to people during mania but I can't fucking stop :((( In this episodes I start talking like an insane person and saying incoherences in voice messages to everyone that messages me or talk to me. I'm sad!!! I do and say things about my life that I don't want anybody knows :((((
I just got the diagnosis..,"Hello! First of all, sorry for my English, it's not my first language..."
i’m worried i’m having delusions again. Either that or my apartment is haunted.,I keep seeing things out of the corner of my eye and hearing things in the other room and it’s freaking me out. I might set up a camera. If I do i’ll document the footage bc I never know what’s real or not when i’m manic.
Denial,"I just want to say thank you to everyone who shares their stories here. I’ve been in denial about being bipolar. Yes, I’m still in a denial state. I’ve been diagnosed with a multitude of disorders. This being a recent one. (Instead of ocd, GA, Depression, adhd, and possible pmdd.) after reading a lot of your stories and issues I seem to relate more than I wanted too. I’m still working on accepting this or even if I am. I just want to say thank you and continue to post your journey. It’s inspiring I hope everyone had a great Monday❤️"
Home vs Hospital,"After an especially bad inpatient experience, I'm wondering if anyone has learned how to cope with mania/psychosis at home with family helping. Like taking sleeping pills and being locked in a room for a few days until it passes. When groups and tweaks to medication don't accomplish anything -- and your just being hospitalized to stay safe.... can this just be done at home to avoid the risk of landing in an emotionally abusive facility. Has anyone tried this?"
when I drink I get the best ideas,when I drink I dream about abandoning my marriage and disappearing myself to another country. sometimes I even find myself making plans. one time i even packed a bag and lined up a ride. then I wake up sober the next day and realize what a bad idea that is. but the idea of destroying my current life makes me feel so euphoric when i’m unhinged.
Did anyone feel like this as a child?,"I was recently diagnosed as bipolar, and thinking back I remember ringing in my ear, blindness briefly (ruled as stress), headaches due to stress, feeling like my brain was above my body,  fitting in but needing to be alone, obsessing over different things, racing thoughts or horrible thoughts?  I remember being anxious very young?  Anyone else feel like this all their lives?"
It’s so crazy how being hyper sexual includes thoughts,"I don’t have sexual experience yet, but I’ve recently learned that hyper sexuality includes thoughts. I have a very strong libido and I always wondered how people with a normal libido thought. I’ve had very freaky/kinky thoughts over the years that I was actually ashamed of. It wasn’t until recently that I learned that this is part of being hyper sexual. This disorder is complicated. Can anyone relate?"
How to deal with the loneliness caused by bipolar?,"What I mean by this is not the literal sense of being alone, but the loneliness of not being understood by others. People can know the definition and symptoms, but they don't know how it truly feels. They don't understand the trauma, the pain and just how much of a struggle it can cause in your life. I feel like i've lived a thousand lifetimes because of what I have been through, but people can't see that. To me it seems like people only see the surface, they just see the times when you weren't at your best because you were ill. They don't realise the strength that it took to keep going, to live through those darkest moments. I guess it's just sad to be perceived in a certain way by the people I care about. I just think if people had to live in our shoes then they would have a lot more empathy because this life can be so damn hard. Any advice on how to try and reduce this feeling of loneliness would be really appreciated."
"Accidentally applied to too many jobs while hypo, what should I do?","Last week, suddenly was resolved to cure my unemployment and went to apply at least 20? jobs. Now everyone is replying at the same time and its stressing me out. Any advice? I would like to not be unemployed anymore cos need the money but idk what to choose"
Why Do Patients Have To Hound Providers To Do Their Job?,So had to go to work to pick up prescription refills.   Thank God tye drive through was open as my anxiety was high at the thought of having to go in the store let alone be around people I don't know. (Had a recent traumatic event happen at work couple weeks ago that F-ed me up mentally and emotionally and has now caused me to start slipping into a mixed depressive episode) well tye two I phones in two days ago where ready.
How to snap out of a deep depression,
"Damn, I’m starting to enjoy my life.",
"Once again…running out of meds. Thanks, doc.","I have seen the same psychiatrist for almost ten years. She’s a lovely lady, she’s helped me get on the right meds and that’s been incredible. However, she is the MOST DISORGANIZED PERSON I HAVE EVER MET. Her office is a mess of papers and files and books and pamphlets and empty cups everywhere. On several occasions, she misses responding to CVS’ request to fill my meds. This has been 10-15 times offer the past 5 years. A few months ago, I had to go off my ADHD medication because she wouldn’t do it. And now, I’ve been halving my dose of Trileptal because I’ve been “Awaiting Prescriber Response” for days. It should not be my responsibility to send a personalized email to this woman every month to say “hey, fill my meds so you don’t have to get a call from the psych ward!” This is literally her job, it’s not that hard. I’d find another doctor, but waitlists are long and I don’t want to have to rehash my whole life story to a new one."
Struggling with finding joy on Abilify and Topamax,"Hey Y'all, so I've been on Abilify for a while now and one of the biggest things I've noticed is I can't find joy in things I used to. Video games, TV shows, movies, they all bore me now and I can't enjoy them like I used to before being medicated. Even work has become so much more of a drag since starting this round of meds."
Better?,I feel like things aren't going to get better no matter how hard I try. I checked into an impatient program on 4/19 so I mean it hasn't been that long since I found out I don't have depression but bipolar instead. I know it hasn't been long but it seems that I'm trying but like I still can't function like normal. Getting out of the house and being around people (including work) has been the toughest thing for me. I had to call in again because of it and I couldn't stop crying. Is that part normal. When will things be better?
Feeling the depression crawling in your head,"I just had a manic episode last month. It wasn't serious, in fact it was quite useful. I was able to get around things I had been postponing and I felt really good for a change. Like always I started to make big plans and put a lot of focus to it. But the last few days I noticed it, the damn feeling of not being able to think straight, I can't keep my attention on anything, I'm losing interest in things and I'm always tired. I know it's my depression kicking in and I just hate being able to see the contrast between being on top of the world and just wanting to be in bed the whole day. Do you notice that?"
Mucking it up,"Sometimes I feel like all I am is the muck and mire of the worst of life. Everyone who gets close to me gets sucked in and consumed themselves, so people mostly avoid me."
Mental Health Care In The US,It’s extremely frustrating how difficult it is to be seen by a psychiatrist and on top of that having to go through being re-diagnosed bc your health insurance changed bc you had an episode & got fired.
Opening up,"Lately I’ve been having a hard time being my authentic self. Because of my recent episode, I feel ashamed and that I can never let anyone know that part of me. Because of this I have a hard time opening up and showing myself to others… even close friends"
how to stop being irritated and anxious 24/7?,"i recently graduated from high school. i thought school was the main reason i’ve been so depressed and anxious. now that i’m done with school i should feel happy and relaxed but i feel the same, maybe even worse. it’s been 1 week of summer and i’ve been constantly stressed and barely sleeping and when i do sleep i get nightmares. i feel like i’m wasting time because i have to get a job, workout everyday, get my drivers license, prepare for college, etc. i even get stressed when i’m just hanging out with friends. does anyone else get like this? how do you calm yourself down?"
"When my boyfriend tells me, “you don’t seem very depressed”","Sometimes I’ll text him that I’m feeling low and he’ll invite me over. When I have the energy, I’ll make the 20 minute drive over. He has a beautiful property that my dog loves to run around on. It always immediately improves my mood even if by just a small amount. “You seem pretty happy to me” makes me immediately remember how I was feeling before I came over, feel like fraud, like I’m faking having these mood swings. It’s possible to smile during depression. Not sure if that’s an unpopular opinion, but it’s true for me at least. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten similar comments while in an “up” mood (hypomania, I just hate that term). Just annoying. Pointing it out just makes me spiral in self destructive thoughts."
How can you tell the difference between a productive and non-productive thought? And how do you stop them?,"I don't know if anyone else is prone to this, but normally 99% of the time my brain is constantly thinking up ""solutions"" or plans for the future to instill in my life that will ""make it easier."" I feel like I've tied my brain into knots running around in circles, coming up with so many ideas of ""today will be the day I start journaling!"" where I am reading books on self help, taking notes on what works best for me, and consolidating it. Or, ""this fall, I'm going to enroll in xyz classes at this time and then I can work abc days and.."" and it just keeps looping! It's like I'm trying to hyper-optimize my future, and I'm not focusing on my present at all."
Sodium Valproate? I’m desperate for info on this,I’ll try to make this as brief as possible. Thanks for reading X
Self control during mania/hypo mania?,"I’ve read a lot of stories about how during mania or hypo mania people have spent thousands of dollars, totalled cars, or done some other risky things. I wonder what level of self control or awareness do we have during those times?"
Bipolar reactions?,I didnt know where else to take this question. I'm feeling so lonely right now and so angry about it too. My mood has been lower recently too.
Stability,
i don’t know if the people around me will ever trust me again,"when I’m well I’m very high functioning, to the point where things I really do and am capable of sound like grandiose delusions. I think I probably come across as a compulsive liar to people who haven’t seen my creds. I haven’t even been formally diagnosed as bipolar. it’s still unclear if my issues were drug-withdrawal and PTSD related or if I’m for real bipolar. either seem likely enough to me. I’m doing well. I’m eating and sleeping a lot. I’m more productive than I ever have been. I fucking hate the feeling that so many people around me are terrified of me having energy. it’s really made me realize who actually knows me and who doesn’t know me at all, and it’s heartbreaking to see just how many people I trusted really don’t know me. I hate this feeling. my family has the green light to hospitalize me, call the cops, forcibly inject me with abilify if they decide it’s necessary, but they’re still so fucking wary it hurts."
Mild akathesia only sometimes?,Wondering if anyone has a similar experience; some days I randomly get akathesia before bed and can't sleep. It lasts a few hours and is unbearable until it mysteriously goes away on its own. It unfortunately only seems to happen when I'm exhausted which makes for a terrible combination. I also take my meds before bed and I'm sure it's related somehow. This doesn't happen often at all. Since my meds otherwise work well I'm hesitant to mess with them.
Bored,"So, I've basically got my life and my depression under control. I have a job. I can handle day to day chores. I can socialize. Most of the symptoms I've had in the past appear to be gone."
How do you manage to do stuff after destroying your life?,"Hi, art student here, i just lost my gf due to a manic episode, i can't live with it and i have not been able to draw or paint for days, i just play videogames and hide from myself, how the hell can i start living again???"
Is this a little psychosis slipping into my depression?,Hello I am diagnosed with bipolar but I’m still processing that.
Emergency room,
I hate how I ruin all my relationships,"I cause irreversible damage to every relationship I have, especially with my few decent family members. I'm also autistic, and bad ptsd due to abuse. There is no understanding of who I am because nobody can stick around long enough for me to trust and tell them. I am so closed off and socially unaware that I just don't have words to describe why every little thing I do and say is so messed up. I AM THE PROBLEM BUT IF I CAN'T EVEN SPEAK ABOUT IT COHERENTLY, NOBODY CAN HELP ME. Even when I just stay quiet and alone at home my presence is enough to anger my sibling who is the only consistent person in my life. WHY WHY WHY I HATE IT I HATE ME. I AM NOT A GOOD OR BAD PERSON, I AM A WRONG PERSON"
I love to colour! My colouring!,
Someone with ultradian bd?,"I'm new in this whole thing, I've recently been diagnosed and I've only really started to notice the quick changes in my behaviour after the diagnosis, I was so focused on my depressive state that I thought having hypomanic episodes was pretty much normal (?) I hate having a change of episode every single hour, I want to know if I'm alone here lol"
From the book: Brave New World 30 years after,"The really hopeless cases of mental illness are to be found among the people who seem to be most normal. Many of them are normal because they are so well adapted to our way of life and their their human voice has been silenced so early in life that they do not even silenced so early in life that they don't even fight back or suffer or develop symptoms like the neurotics. They are, as one might say, normal not in the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adaptation to this abnormal society is a measure of their mental illness. These millions of abnormally normal people, who live without difficulty in a society to which, if they were fully human, they would not be adapted. to which they should not be adapted if they were full human beings, still cherish the illusion of individuality. illusion of individuality. In fact, however, they have been de-individualised to a high degree. Their conformity is conformity is developing into something like uniformity. But uniformity and freedom are incompatible. Uniformity and mental health are also incompatible. health are also incompatible ... Man was not created to be an automaton, and if he becomes one, the basis of mental health is destroyed. the basis of mental health is destroyed."
I’m tired ALL THE TIME,I’m literally tired all the time. This has been going on for years. I haven’t had mania or hypo mania in years so this is all while on meds. But all different types of meds and currently non with drowsiness as a side effect. My anxiety is always super high too but I also can’t stay awake so it’s a weird combination so doctors don’t believe me. When I say tired I mean like my eyes can hardly stay open and I need at least 14 hours of sleep. I have no idea what’s going on but it’s been years and I can’t even drive long distances unless I talk to someone (still max one hour) or my eyes just close. It’s so bad. Does anyone else have this issue?
How do you know you’re making the right decision?,"So I know everyone can probably relate… I have to make quite an important decision but how do I know when I’m mentally able and well enough to think rationally and make the right decision? I can’t trust my thinking when manic, and I also can’t trust myself when depressed! So I have to wait for that miraculous few days where I’m neutral, whenever that might be. What is your process while making important decisions? How do you do it?"
It's rising,"I feel it, just behind my forehead. I feel my adrenal rise my cortisol levels rise. My heart beats faster. That's what I know a manic episode is about to begin. And it's all downhill from here. I hope I don't say or do anything stupid in the next few days. I've had a few manic where I lost everything every person in my life I lost and had to start over that happened one of the time I was devastated and I slept deeper into my depression. and my manic episodes got even worse. I sometimes wind up at some strangers house during crystal meth and feeling oh so guilty. Trying to figure out how I got there because the day before was a blur. I have to check my Amazon account to see how much I've spent this week. I check with my friends, well the ones I got left, to see who I pissed off and who's not talking anymore God I hate it. And the older I get the worst they get"
Decreased imagination/no more coherent dreams.,Hello everyone (24M) . Been fighting this battle alone since 2020. In the last few months I’ve noticed I’m not having any dreams. Even if i had dreams it was completely random events and mostly nightmares. My imagination is non existent anymore. I can’t even drift and go back to memory lane. My memory is beginning to fade ever so slowly (I can’t recall past events easily) and my creativity is at an all time low.
Barrack,Come for me
Brain Scan,"Hi! I’m feeling rather defeated in this journey of Bipolar trying to find the right meds. My psych just recently told me that manic episodes cause irreparable brain damage, and it got me wondering as to if I can request a brain scan to see the damage myself and maybe just maybe validate the diagnosis or invalidate it and prove I’ve been misdiagnosed. Has anyone done this?"
I forgot to take my meds,"I forgot yesterday for the first time since starting this new stuff and I have to say I think it’s got me all messed up. I’m emotional and sensitive and feeling so fragile. I hate this. I think I’ll stay in today. Maybe I’ll write. I don’t know. I just need to get out of this head space. It’s bad. Makes me scared for a day when I stop taking them, not that I plan to or anything but I’d like to try and manage myself on my own one day in the future but I don’t want to slip into a massive depression when I do decide to. And I know I need to do it with the help of my psychiatrist. Don’t mind my stream of thought please. My head is such a mess."
I would recommend a smartwatch for everyone with bipolar disorder,Honestly.
Why does this make me mad?,"I got told by a friend I made that I don't seem bipolar cause I'm too chill and that just made me so mad like, maybe it's all the meds I'm taking that are actually working lmao."
How to deal with Hypersexuality and hyperfixation,
Do you tell your S/O when you’re having a depressive episode?,
Hyper-sexuality is ruining my marriage,I (f/33) is currently suffering from hyper-sexuality. I have not suffered it for a good 3-4 yrs thanks to medication and therapy.
Bipolar & Menstruation: A Miserable Combo,"Obviously having your period is awful even without a mood disorder but damn, I'm miserable. In my early twenties when my bipolar was shiny & new, my period would make me a little hypomanic which honestly wasn't that bad. It was never anything extreme & a welcome break from my ""normal"" which, at the time, was occasionally level but more often severely depressed."
Insatiable Hunger,I was a diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year ago and currently I take Li and Levothyroxine. I have had experienced an episode of hypersexuality but this time it's the same urge and itching but for food. Have you people experienced it and how can I get past it?
Mania and Self Harm,
Is nail biting or hair pulling something that you struggle with during or leading up to a high or low?,DAE bite their nails or pull hair out?
I FINALLY start intensive outpatient therapy tomorrow! 🥲❤️,A lot has been happening within the past 8 weeks of my life which has led me to be mentally not okay.
Anybody feel “terminal?”,
Mood chart from 4/5 to yesterday.,
Can’t regulate temp when manic?,"When i’m manic i feel so hot, especially if i’m trying to sleep. I can’t figure out how to control if. I get upset bc i’m so hot but i cat cool down. just me?"
"Funny story, I think?","I was watching something that discussed why people travel.  They mentioned to heighten emotions.  Through a voice that nearly cracked, I commented, “I don’t need any of that, I’m bipolar”.  I thought it was hilarious, but it’s also been a rough few days where basically everything makes me cry"
do you ever feel like you’re making it all up?,my mom use to tell me i was just a bad kid and would do harmful things just for attention. even when i tried to commit she still didn’t believe me that i was truly going through stuff ig. now i sometimes feel like im making my whole mental illness up in my head. i’ve been officially diagnosed as bipolar but i still need my therapist to confirm with me a lot that im not being over dramatic or a bad person
Bad memories coming back,
hyposexuality might be ruining my relationship,"so I've been diagnosed bipolar since I was 15 (I'm 20 now) and it runs on my mom's side of the family. seriously, like 7 gens of bipolar women. anyways, my partner and I have been together for almost two years now. when we first got together, I was very hypersexual. like doing the deed multiple times everyday."
Calming-ish Music Recommendations,"What music recommendations do y’all have for calming anxiety before it becomes mania or hypomania? I just got a dog and he’s really anxious sometimes, so I am trying to play things that relax both of us. I have a feeling I could be close to a spiral if I don’t work on my coping. But I love him, and I am hoping music will continue helping as it is right now :)))))"
Last night I prayed to God that if he and an afterlife were real to show me in a way that made me certain.,I was having an absolute mental breakdown at like 5 in the morning.
"I (24f) think I’m ready to start a part time job, but I’m terrified about potentially working with men","I’m happily married, but hypersexuality is an absolute monster. I’ve cheated once and it almost broke us, and I’m not willing to let that happen again. But I know that all it would take is being around another guy when an episode hits and then I’d make a choice that I’d forever regret. I’m not myself when I get like that and act so dumb."
What if ECT isn’t working? Where do you go from there?,
Having to settle for a zero alcohol beer and a nicotine inhaler instead of the vape and red wine I really want. Bipolar is rough man,
Do you get annoyed when people say ‘they’re bipolar’ instead of ‘they have bipolar?’,There’s always mixed feelings. I’m not too sure of it myself. I’d rather them say they have bipolar but I don’t think it’s the end of the world. What do you think?
Struggling with routine,"So I was only diagnosed recently and have spent some time learning about bipolar and everything to do with it and I have noticed that one of the things that seems important is routine, especially with sleep.  I am struggling with this currently as my job does alternating shift times with one week being 8am-4pm and the other week 3pm-11pm.  With these times it is very difficult, near impossible to keep a consistent sleep routine.  I feel like my job isn't realisticly sustainable for me and I have already been feeling the effects of it with depression episodes hitting harder and harder, to the point where I have been calling in sick because I couldn't get out of bed.  Any advice or even stories of people in similar situations would be greatly appreciated as I am feeling very down at the moment and lost with it all."
Can’t relax to watch a movie/TV,"I have struggled with this for YEARS.  I think it’s a side effect of my medications.  I can’t just sit and watch TV.  I will scroll through the menus on Netflix or whatnot, but never actually pick anything to watch.  Or if I do, I get bored with it and end up turning it off."
travel anxiety,"I'm sitting at the train station getting ready to go home from visiting family. The trip was 50/50 I'd say, 50% good/50% bad. I always have anxiety when I travel but during most of the trip I've been dissociated so now I'm just sitting here really, really anxious. The train should be here soon, so that'll be good. I'm gonna get on the train and try to relax. I had to take one of my take as needed anti-anxiety meds so I'm hoping that'll kick in soon."
Newly diagnosed,I was just diagnosed with bipolar 2 and it feels great to finally know what was going on with me since I was a teenager and feels good to put a name to it. If anyone has any advice moving forward that would be much appreciated.
Was anybody left traumatized by being hospitalized?,"I was hospitalized in November 2023. When I got out of the hospital, I was traumatized, by the way they treated me like an inmate. Feeded us low quality food. Had a little outside courtyard, never let us outside. Once a week exercise. Mind numbing supposedly group therapy. Only got to see the therapist once a day, when we did talk it was never about getting help. Psychiatrist talked more about what new pill that they were going to shove down your throat."
Has anyone participated in a Oura Ring study?,"Hey folks, sorry if I didn’t use this flair properly. So, the mental health centre I deal with is running a study about bipolar patients’ sleep/wake cycles and mood, tracked with the Oura ring. They’re hoping to have you wear the ring 24/7, except for 1hr to charge every week. I am kinda interested to participate. They will pay I think 2$ CAD per day, hoping for up to 2 years. I’d like to do it but I have some concerns, first being that I’m worried that I won’t be a good subject, because I don’t usually wear any jewelry at all so I might be wanting to take it off a lot. Second being that I am not very good at being consistent with keeping a mood chart... which is important! Last is that I’m worried about the electromagnetic/Bluetooth waves being constantly on my body, I’ve heard that it’s not good for you. I try  it to have my phone right on my all the time. But I really want to help with the study?? Has anyone participated in such a study or similar? How did you find it? Could you keep up with the expectations? Thanks!"
Sports fandom,Does anybody find sports fandom overwhelming?

How to not hang out with person without hurting them,My nephew has schizoaffective disorder. We've been chatting over Instagram for a while. Now he wants to hang out.
Changes in Time Perception,"Does anyone else have significant changes in time perception during mood disorders? I am in a depression phase right now and as it gets worse my perception of the passing of time starts to really … change. Usually moments slow down and seem long, followed by hours going by in minutes."
Elephant,All are elephants
Terrified of another mixed episode,"I have bipolar II and my last mixed episode was so awful that I'm afraid I won't be able to make it through another one. Since then, I have started taking Lamictal, slowly titrating up and on 50mg now. It seems to be working well so far to squash negative, obsessive thought patterns, so I am trying to stay hopeful. I have definitely had my normal early summer hypomanic symptoms, nothing too destructive but it still makes me suspicious because I know from experience that can slide into dysphoric hypomania pretty quickly."
Help With An Episode,"Hello all -- first off, wishing you all well on your respective journeys through this thing and in general."
Bipolar moment hardcore,"So, I joined this website, after yeaarrrrrs of avoiding it, because my family is struggling right now to pay our damn bills and feed our damn pets. I’ve posted all over GoFundMe pages on Facebook, had friends post on Twitter, and I came here because my partner uses Reddit a lot…which personally experience so far, has been fucking awful. Most people have messaged me trying to scam me, banned my pages, or just been a fucking asshole to me.  Like I seriously need help! Why does everyone love Reddit so much? Like I just got referred to a page where I could get pet food donated and I banned for life because my page isn’t 90 days old. It made me so fucking manic, it’s not even funny.                                                            I consider myself fairly understanding of people considering I am bipolar, among other things, with a psych degree, and I work in the field….though I just lost my job due to an infection  that was so bad I got referred to a specialist and right now the fucking earliest anyone can see me is August.                                                           I’m posting in this thread to say I’m so pissed off at the internet and giving Reddit one last chance because I could really use another place to have support right now. I’ve lost my job, my income, my car is fucked up, my cat almost died because he’s diabetic and is so low on insulin and needs a curve (he had a moment the other day), and I’m so behind on my bills I do not want to loose my house. Believe me my life has been one shit so, and this is nothing compared to it. But just last summer I was so manic I attempted suicide. Different story for a different day. Basically, I’m feeling manic because I’m just getting fucked over all the time it feels like and I’m constantly helping people out when I’m in a good place but it never seems to be the same back. Does anyone feel like this? If anyone even reads this shit."
Bipolar 1 here!! I stopped drinking completely and I’ve felt nothing but depressed since I stopped. Should I tell my doctor?,I stopped drinking where I was drinking a couple glasses of wine daily. And I might of been self medicating with all the bipolar meds I take. Now that I’m not drinking my moods have been spiking up and down more but I noticed I’ve been feeling really low/depressed/isolating. Not sure wether this feeling will pass or if I need a med adjustment for how low I’ve been feeling.
Cant afford help but I need it,Has anyone else gone through this? I am having delusional thoughts about the police being out to get me. Its gotten to the point that I barely sleep and cant trust anyone. I feel like I need help but I just cant afford it. Any advice would be lovely thank you.
Has anyone experienced the Dark Night of the Soul?,I got diagnosed with mania/bipolar during one of my stages of the Dark Night of the Soul. Now I'm not saying I'm not bipolar nor wasn't manic but I had to go through that process. I had to think I was the second coming of Jesus at a point. I had to think I was on top of the world. I had to have my delusions to come back down to a new reality. Am I alone in this?
Struggling to hold out till my therapy session on Thursday,I been experiencing executive dysfunction and ADHD symptoms (as well anhedonia)
Potentially going into hypomania?,I feel like because I’ve been waking up extremely early like 7/8 after going to sleep at 2/3 is my first warning sign.
Help understanding episodes/cycles,Hi friends - Was diagnosed BP2 in December and feeling like an idiot cause I still don’t understand the difference between mixed state and rapid cycling or whatever shit I don’t know about?
Why do I feel stuck in between needing my meds and not wanting them at all,I’ve been dealing with bipolar for like a year or so and ADHD shit since I’ve been a kid but just starting taking treatment for both last year. Honestly adderall has done wonders for me but I just can’t get with ambilify I get so randomly triggered so I know i need it but idk man
"bipolar people in college, how do you do it?","i’m about to start college this fall, and im actually terrified. it’s an hour and a half away from home and i’m not allowed to have a car, which means i have to stop seeing my therapist. i only have one friend who’s coming with me but we’re not allowed to room together because she’s in the music college and im in the natural sciences college, and my best friends who are my biggest support systems aren’t graduated yet."
Too pretty to be depressed,"I can remember several people in the past telling me that I was too pretty to be depressed. Some of these people that told me this were medical professionals. Like no, I just come from a long line of mentally ill baddies but I’m the first one to put my foot down. I remember going to the doctors office not knowing what the fuck was wrong with me, why I felt so depressed, and they would usually say, “You’re a very pretty girl and you seem very smart I’m sure you’ll be fine.” And then they would say I had dysthymia disorder or cyclothymia, or it was major depression, or some other bullshit and my general practitioner prescribed me SSRIS so that made me have my first full blown manic episode and even with that I wasn’t diagnosed with BD1 they just switched me to a different SSRI. It never made me feel any better when they would call me attractive, if anything it made me feel less heard."
Hypomania wrestling reference/story,"No one I know would find this story funny so I thought I’d share it here. I’m bipolar II and my partner and I like watching wrestling, and whenever Wrestlemania season starts in WWE the wrestlers all point to the big Wrestlemania sign in the middle of the show to insinuate they’ll win big at their match that night or something like that. It’s “the road to Wrestlemania”. My partner and I decided I have “the road to hypomania”, and now any time I feel a hypomania spell coming on, I point at a wrestling sign we made for a WWE show we saw live together."
I quit my job today,I came back from medical leave to a company I’ve worked at for almost 5 years and I found out that several higher ups and my coworkers were all taking bets on how long it would take me to call out/quit. Literally taking bets on my failure.
I bought an expensive...,"New face product I've never used before (a serum)... I will definitely be a new and better person from the first use. When I wake up, I'll be a better person than before this impulse purchase. Right? Right?? I'll settle for being an unstable being with radiant skin TBH."
What should be included - bare minimum - in a psych ward?,"What policies, environmental features, staffing, etc should be bare minimum in every psych ward, no matter where it is located and how it is being paid for (universal health care, private health care, whatever)???"
My mood is SO much worse,"So a couple months ago I started getting pretty sick, eventually I noticed a large lump on the right side of my neck. I got it checked out and my doctors sending me for a bunch of tests, blood, ct scan, ultrasound. He said I have a cyst on my thyroid. I did NOT know how severely thyroid issues could affect you physically as well as mentally. Besides feeling sick constantly and being bed ridden most of the time, It has multiplied the issues my bipolar already causes by like fucking 10. I haven’t been this low in so long, and nothing even happened. It’s just cause I have a stupid lump on my neck. 🙃 I can’t tell if my meds have stopped working or if it’s just cuz my cyst is being a bad friend. I thought about drawing a smiley face on it and making me feel better. It in fact did not make me feel better. I really hope they take it out soon and I can go back to just being regular bipolar instead of super sized bipolar. Never thought that would be something I’d wish for lmfao. Anyway mostly just venting, thanks for reading this if u do."
Lamictal seems to be really helping me,I have been taking Lamictal for a month now. I started tracking my mood about a week ago using Daylio and I’ve felt good for five days straight. That’s like a world record for me! I am looking forward to more good days on this med!
22 yr old bipolar type 1 woman hoping to feel seen by others,"I guess you can say my diagnosis wasn't an easy one. From two hospital stays in one year about two years ago. Some psychiatrists telling me I am bipolar, some telling me I'm not.. which in return led to my most recent manic episode. Which let me just say, being unmedicated for almost a year the way I was only lasted so long. Getting back on the meds has been a lot to handle. I currently take: Abilify (tablet, and injection), lamictal, clonazepam, and trazadone. Hopefully after my psychiatrist visit on monday all doses go lower since the mania has subsided. It's such a hard journey for all of us. While manic I absolutely love it until I come down from that high and boom I reach the ground.. back to reality as they say. The one thing I can't escape anymore. I started my journey undiagnosed and self medicating. I suffered from psychosis and mania most, but lately it seems like depression is making a visit. Any advice would help, sending you all love and peace. To end this I just want to share a short line from my poem,"
Lowered Lithium + Upped SSRI 3 month chart,

I hate summer,"Summer is always the worst for my mental state. No school = no schedule = no stability. Everything in my mind that I’ve been burying under school stress is coming to the surface. Doesn’t help that I don’t have a job rn either to distract me. Makes me worried for life after I graduate college next semester. Is this how the rest of my life will be ? I need a constant distraction. I feel like I have no purpose and nothing is stimulating enough. Nothing motivates me. Nothing cures this intense , painful boredom that terrorizes me everyday. Life seems so monotonous. There’s so much I can do with my days but I choose to just go on my phone and lay in bed. The only responsibility I have is going to the gym everyday. But after I get home I feel so empty again."
Officially off Lithium for the first time.,"I’m 31 and I started taking Lithium when I was 20, when I first started having my crazy manic episodes.  It worked well but it gave me terrible fucking back acne.  I always felt insecure about it and I had enough and asked my psychiatrist if I could go off of it.  She eventually said we could try it and I started going off of it in July (long time right, 11 fucking months).  I’m on lamictal and latuda as well so she said the meds probably will still be at a therapeutic range but it’s a big risk but I am a risk taker.  Luckily the reward outweighed the risk and everything went well and my back acne is pretty much gone.  I’m so glad everything worked out.  No mania detected yet and I don’t think it will happen because I take good care of myself.  So far so good.  Just thought I’d share."
"My Abilify said ""smile"" today :)",
bioplar social life,"hey guys!! i just wanted to update and say i’m doing so much better socially. everyone in my grade doesn’t think about the dululu things i did and no one is uncomfortable around me. if anything they feel bad for what i went through. it took a while but i realized i couldn’t isolate myself over and over again. if i did that they would only remember the old version of me. once i put myself out there people didn’t think about it. y’all don’t give up, keep going and take risks (not manic risks though lol)"
I am better yes but i am not stable and im starting to think its not in the cards,"I am the best ive ever been. I have a good relationship with ALL of my family, i have an amazong relationship, i am not struggling financially, i have a car and my license, i do hoyse chores, i get shit done but my mood is all over the place and im on so many medications like so many like 2 benadryl a day, lithium, latuda, seroquel, effexor, clonidine, birth control, allergy meds (that dont work), lipitor, vitamin d supplement. I just wanna be stable for me please. Just for a little bit. I dont need forever just so i can figure out life for myself for when i get mood swings. Find a profession i can handle, find some hobbies i can handle, find a friend who wont leave, make a meal plan, make a schedule. Just find some stability. Im in so much desperation and no one in my life besides my sister understands how debilitating this is. Im at my whits end."
Can I vent for a minute? The last two days have been super fucking heavy and I’m spiraling,
"Bipolar and hyper sexual, how do you deal with it?",I’ve been diagnosed as bipolar with OCD since 2005 (I’m 41) and probably the biggest obstacle I’ve continued to face and has caused me problems at work and at home over the years is an addiction to sex and porn. I’ve tried many different medications over the years and some have worked for a short period of time but I always find myself back to my old ways. I’ve done behavioral therapy but that didn’t work obviously. So just wondering who else has dealt with this and how has it affected ur life and how do u deal with it now?
Little mad,

Any tips on helping your partner help you?,"I've been dating this guy for a few months now and it's been great. We are both college students. Summers always haven't been the best for my mental health. I dont have access to medication, a therapist, and where I'm living is always up in the air over the summers. Since my mental health team is in a different state in the summers I brave it through and it's pretty ugly. My boyfriend never seeing this side of me before is like very worried and almost coming off as judgemental. Saying things like brushing your hair is good for you and you shouldn't have skipped that meal. Considering the circumstance, I think I'm doing pretty and I'm trying my best. Does anyone have tips or suggestions on how to help my partner out a little?"
Should I tell my diagnosis during interview?,"I have an interview coming up and I'm not sure if I should tell my new employer about my diagnosis. My last job didn't know and I got fired for not being productive enough. I'm doing pretty well now, but I don't want to mess up my chances of getting hired by telling them and I also don't want to risk them finding out later and it becoming a problem. What do you think?"
Have you switched psychologists or psychiatrists because you feel other possible issues/diagnoses haven’t been addressed?,I’ve been seeing my psychologist for less than a year and I don’t feel this person listens to me and my issues/problems that I’ve had all my life.  When I bring this up immediately she is dismissive.
Massive panic attack,"As the title implies I had the worst panic attack of my life. I was being driven home after having lasik. I was nervous during the procedure but I think not being able to see and feeling disoriented afterwards fueled my nervousness. I was almost home when it hit. I passed out for part of it and when I came to I was plastered against the passenger seat hyperventilating, profusely sweating, limbs were deadweight and I was screaming. I genuinely thought I was dying because it lasted 20 minutes and it felt like it was never going to end. It freaked my mom out so much she called an ambulance. They were kind enough to walk me inside where I then puked. I don't mean to use the word lightly but it felt traumatizing. While my mom and boyfriend were really supportive afterwards they'll never fully know what it's like to have your brain turn on you so horrifically. I just wanted to share with a group of people who have been through something similar because it makes me feel less alone in this experience. Thanks for listening/reading."
"Voices, but I know they're not real","I was recently diagnosed, and during my last manic episode, whenever I would close my eyes to go to sleep, I noticed that I would hear random incoherent talking, almost like I'm in a room with people having their own conversations, except it wasn't that loud, and I knew it was all in my head. This seems to have stopped once I got treatment, anyone else deal with this? (I never had any delusional ideas, I mostly dealt with mood swings and poor impulse control)"
Recently diagnosed,"Hello there I am a male age 23 recently diagnosed with bipolar all my life I have struggled mentally and physically never knowing what caused it by profession I am graphic designer with a stable job and have a good salary but recently its becoming very hard for me to keep myself in control I love to play games on weekends so I was thinking about buying a racing wheel controller(sim setup) which I cannot afford without making a massive dent in my livelihood because I have a family to take care of and all the other payments sometimes I will have episodes feeling victimized that I can't buy anything that I want and will shout or argue with my mother but afterwards I feel very guilty because I love her a lot my dad has been away since I was a kid, I don't have any friends because of me acting like a psychopath sometimes if they ignore me Or anything I just feel sucidal when there is no one to talk to and the guilt keeps me awake at night it's becoming very painfull each and everyday :) hope I'll be able to live a normal life again just want to make my mom proud but all I do is argue with her acuse her of things she never did sometimes it's just unbearable"
Online ADHD or ASD assessments and Bipolar,See so many (TikTok mostly) take these as part of self diagnosing and thought I’d piss around. Tried an ADHD one & 3 of the autism tools.
Has anyone considered tattooing a reminder on their hand to focus on their healing?,My issue is that I’m constantly so distracted and have such shifting energy levels and obsessions and I am endangering myself by neglecting the fact that I have a mental health disorder.
Sinking Into. Mixed (depressive) Episode,"So I had something traumatic happen at work (retail) a couple weeks ago. (Customer wanted money from me to buy cigarettes, I told them I had non, he/we went through process several times, he then forcefully poked my glasses, the lense, and threatened I better rethink the answer before spotting then he did walk off as the grocery manager approached, then in the process of being kicked out by said manger for shoplifting and causing a scene in the grocery department, he ran across me again stared me down and punched a box of freight in the cart I'd been working) now I'm anxious all the time at work like I'm in iminant danger at every moment, and to an extent in public (that it's not safe)."
Learn more about my diagnosis…,"I was diagnosed with bipolar like a year ago. I’ve been manic like 5 times in my life, depressed and hypomanic a lot more. Lately I’ve experienced periods when I feel so angry and irritated. Some times I get stuck at home and don’t even understand what I feel not depressed but like my thoughts just go round and round in my head and I don’t know how to get out. I also get periods when I’m more sensitive to noise and a lot of things happening at once. I feel like I haven’t really understood my different periods because I always thought that life was like that for everybody. When I read posts here I’m starting to think there is more to the bipolar diagnosis that I haven’t understood. How can I learn more about bipolar? Everywhere I look for information there is just like a very shallow description of how you change from depression to mania and that’s it. I would like to read something that can describe how hypomania and mania can manifest and feels in different ways. I don’t know maybe it sounds stupid… If you know some book or something I can read I would be so thankful."
I use to be the life of party and know I don’t know how to talk to people,For the past few years going threw hypomania I was always the life of party and was great at talking to people. My period of depression I would isolated and not talk to anybody so it was never a problem. Now that I’m diagnosed and medicate I go out to place like work or wedding and I have no clue how to make small talk to talk to people. I feel awkward uncomfortable and just forced. How do I find a medium between social butterfly and complete introvert?
Just announce I have bipolar on instagram?,"Just trusted a stranger with my diagnosis, she said nothing to be ashamed of. On her social is her and a friend making fun of Gollum as a depiction or like poster child for bipolar"
"Well, today I got diagnosed with bipolar 2","Today, after speaking to my psychiatrist after weeks of evaluation, got diagnosed with bipolar 2. I don’t know what to think. I’ve been diagnosed with MDD and anxiety Since I was a kid after a hospital stay, then going to rehab for two weeks. I think I’ve been bipolar since I was as young as 13, which is when I started noticing the intense mood changes and sudden anger, leading to severe depression. I don’t know, I guess it’s comforting knowing what it is now, and a lot of people are bipolar. So I guess I’m not alone."

What are some things you’ve noticed about people who have never experienced depression in their life?,I often wonder what it would feel like to have never experienced depression in my life and how different things would be and how happy I could have been. And that often leads me to wonder how the world is experienced from the perspective of a neurotypical who has never dealt with depression for a single second in their life. One instance I was thinking about was the weather. I need the weather to be bright and sunny otherwise I don't feel so good but I know some people love bad/ugly weather. Maybe it's not the best example but it's something I thought about recently.
Hair picking (trichotillomania),"Hi everyone,"
I've been enjoying music again,It's a huge thing for me.
What are mixed episodes,"I am still a bit confused about what exactly a mixed episode is. Is it like having symptoms of depression and mania at the same time. Like for example I have been sad and low in energy for about 2 weeks now but colors are really bright and intens, and I am easily irritated. Would that be concidered a mixed state. In depressive and manic episodes its easier for me to recognize them and therefore to deal with them accordingly. But i am not sure how to deal with mixed episodes (If i am even in one), could you guys maybe provide some examples of your own life or give a better explanation, that would be really helpful!"
I feel like I’ve accomplished nothing in my life. What makes you feel good about yourself?,I was diagnosed when I was in my early teens. I’m now…much older and I find myself constantly struggling to accept all the thing I was unable to do in my life. I finished high school but not college. I’m disabled and don’t work. I have a hard time staying in relationships and have never been married or had kids.
My daily fight in solitude,"Trauma is real. The pure horror that consumes you in moments of past trauma flushing over you is enough to break you in an instant. Like waves crashing through thin glass panes. like a bullet tearing through your heart. It suffocates you, steals the breath out of your lungs. Then as you gasp for air and fight second by second you wonder is this it for me? Am I going to die here alone?"
"Had Hypomania quetiapine almost instantly helped, though it was supposed to take longer","I have been taking quetiapine at low doses for about a year now.  Because I only get hypomania and usually my symptoms start with lack of sleep I'm able to identify an escalating pattern in my mood and  take the drug.  Today I had my first intense bout of hypomania with psychotic symptoms in a long time.  Felt buzzing on my skin the walls were moving, voices.  It felt like a bit of a mixed state because I didn't know how to feel.  I swung from panic attacks to feeling confused but high on energy to feeling incredibly sad but still energetic in a bad way.  Like a nervous energy that I didn't know where to direct."
Should I find a different job?,So I’ve been working 5 days a week nearly full time hours at 6:30/7am since the end of February. Flash forward to now and I still haven’t adjusted to the morning shift. It doesn’t help that I have a hard time sleeping and even the days I get enough sleep I’m still tired. It’s got to the point where I feel like I’m at a low point in my life. I’ve neglected the things I love doing and I’ve basically became a hermit. Any advice?
Your songs for coming out of a depressive episode,"Hi y'all! Finally, it's happening. My six month long depressive episode is finally fucking ending. I've been listening to my songs for a bit and crying out of relief lol, but what do y'all listen to when you come out of a depressive episode?"
Starting to date,"I’m starting to date! I’m 37 and I haven’t dated in forever (I’m embarrassed to say…) Like so many of us, I’ve spent so much of my life working through mental health issues. I am scared and excited. I signed up for Bumble earlier this week. I am nervous, scared, and excited. I don’t really know what to expect. I happy to hear words of encouragement, advise, anything really. I am grateful to have an amazing therapist who is helping me with everything. I also have an incredible friend to bounce everything off of. But I am really so new to this. What has your experience been like dating? Thanks, all!"
How do you suppress/prepare yourself for a manic episode?,"Hello all, new to this subreddit and honestly I’m so glad i found it because i stopped going to cognitive behavioral therapy years ago, i am unmedicated due to my personal history of substance abuse and self-harm, i don’t have anyone else in my life with bipolar disorder type 1. i am really struggling coping lately because i can feel a manic episode coming on, so i wonder how do you guys cope or make use of this energy? i tend to be way overly talkative, i feel like i bother my peers and put myself in unusual social situations so i try to divert this energy by being active on Reddit where no one really knows me. Also i tend to be so anxious and energetic that i have physical tremors at times and my hands cant stop shaking. I was misdiagnosed as a teen which made me spiral due to wrong medication and my whole life i feel like an outcast, i never understood my illness until well into my adulthood and was very toxic to my loved ones because i had no idea how to manage my emotions or breakdowns. I sometimes feel like a slave to my disorder and would love to hear your experiences and thoughts to calm me down. Have a great day all of you and thanks for reading if you made it this far"
Still struggling w lost/broken relationships from mania,"My first and only mania happened about 2 years ago.

"Just need a place to share that I’m feeling down, thank you",Lately I’ve been feeling down. Not in a “I want everything to be over” way but in a way where I’m not enjoying anything.
I feel like I need social interaction 24/7 to function,I'm experiencing some executive dysfunction. I'm extremely bored all the time! It seems the only remedy is social interaction. Even textingmy friends will do the trick.
I need a little support with my cedar episode.,"I feel like I’m losing my mind. I am having a pretty intense mixed episode (not uncommon for me), and don’t want to go to the hospital. I called my psychiatrist and he upped my dose risperidone to 3mg again. I hate the way it is making me feel. It isn’t helping the symptoms at all, but instead is just making me foggy and exhausted. I am afraid to ask for too much help because I don’t want to be admitted. Last time I was admitted I got electroconvulsive therapy and have trauma and memory issues from it. I am worried they may make me get it if I’m there. I just really don’t know what else to do right now and could use some suggestions and support."
second guessing every mood swing,"i dont really see many people talking about this (I don't go on credit often so maybe it is talked about) but the fear of any emotion, every change in my mood makes me worried that its the start of another episode, my last episode was only a month ago, but I've got this over exited and overly optimistic view while the ball of energy in my chest just like my manic episodes start off, I don't usually cycle this quickly but yet I'm still worried its the beginning of another episode"
Have I been wrong all along?,I take the absolute bare minimum of medication that enables me to sleep and not become psychotic (I'm BP1).
"Bipolar II, BPD, just unrelenting anxiety and codependency? Who knows, but I'm hoping to share my experience. TW: substance abuse","For pretty much all my life, I've dealt with chronic anxiety. From tummy aches and nightmares as a toddler, to dissociation and panic attacks in my early 20's. I was much more depressed in high school and struggled with a lot of substance abuse. I got some relief when I started college, mainly just because I felt more free and independent. But that's when my struggle with relationships started."
How do you deal with the changes in your body due to medication?,"I’m honestly having a really hard time with my body image, specifically lithium caused me a really bad acne break out not to mention the weight gain since I started antidepressants. I do not want to sound superficial but I truly struggle to look at my self in the mirror and accept me for who I am. It sucks that I had to choose between my mental health and my physical well-being especially because this is starting to affect me on a mental level: I try to avoid social events, going to the beach among other things. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m in psychotherapy but it doesn’t seem to help. Do you have any tips?"
Falling asleep after 400mg of caffeine and coffee. These meds feel worse than depression.,"I'm on 15 mg of abilify, 300mg of lithium twice a day, and 150mg of trileptal twice a day."
Rejected everywhere,I get rejected personally and romantically most. I got rejected for a promotion at work this week (after my boss secretly promised me the job). I even get rejected for car loans and credit cards. Even that hurts.
Recurring dreams,"TLDR: Can an “anxiety dream” that hasn’t been present in 20+ years come back and be a sign of a pending spiral? I’m going through a difficult, but stable time."
"New manager made me cry. Do I tell her boss (my former boss and mentor) about the interaction, or let it go?","I've been working at my current job in the non-profit sector for nearly 5 years, and for the most part it has been a dream job. I had an awesome boss, great relations with my team, and truly feel like my work makes a difference and matters. Even when I  had a manic episode last year (with psychotic features) my boss was super supportive, kept my confidence about it and didn't make me feel judged at all. I will always be grateful."
Looking for advice about moving abroad and staying healthy,"Hi everyone, just looking for some advice, especially from people who have moved to another country or traveled abroad for an extended period of time."
Leaving a job,Hi - I was just dx bipolar 2 last month. I've been off of work since then after being hospitalized for a depressive episode.
Am I Doing Alright? You let me know,"Hi all! So it's been a while. I was institutionalized following a failed attempt, put on meds, did outpatient treatment for a year THEN my therapist died - I stopped medication for 6 months then I suffered a ""stress induced"" blackout - tried therapy again for about 3 sessions and I've been rawdogging life ever since. That was 2 years ago."
Crushing on my therapist!,Been thinking about my therapist 24/7. It’s crazy! I’m fantasizing about him now that I know that he’s using sexual transference on me. I’m going to see him again on the 30th of the month - planning to pretend that I did not read anything about transference.
"I'm 40, and I lost in life","I don't know, what to do. Everyday seem worse, than previous. My three kids wants me to be with them, but it's natural, even if I was abusive psycopath, who hurt them, they didn't want to lose me. Nobody loves me as who I am. My wife and I almost aliens to each other, we totally different. I swim in dirty river, that has only one end, early or late. I do all what I suppose to, it's very hard to handle, but even harder to see, that all stays the same, and gradually become worse. Sorry for this sad whinig, I have no one to share. Best wishes"
How do you decide if past experiences were hypomania or you just doing weird stuff?,"I'm pending a diagnosis at the moment, and it's got me thinking back through the past few years and looking at things in a more critical light, but there are some grey areas where I can't tell if things I did were just bold or uncharacteristic of me or if they were related to hypomania."
Antidepressant conversation,Just wondering who has an antidepressant as part of their medication regime? What do you take and do you feel that it helps with the depressive symptoms? This depression is really kicking my ass and it won’t go away.
Am I just hypomanic? or am I making progress?,I'm recently diagnosed BP2 and I'm currently going through a bad breakup just as I started lamictal. (I'm on 100mg and it's only been 5 weeks)
Don't feel safe enough to tell my doctor about my hallucinations but I'm afraid they'll get worse,
Laughing while sleeping,I had a normal kind of dream and I found myself semi-waking up laughing a couple of times just to continue sleeping in the same dream. What is this? Is this a psychotic/manic symptom? Anybody else has had this experience?
Unable to get my meds,"It feels like I was just starting to get stable and all of a sudden my antipsychotic got blocked at the pharmacy. I still have my mood stabilizer but I don’t feel right, i feel sick and scared and i’m seeing bugs and shadows in my house and sometimes everything shakes like an earthquake. I know it’s just because I suddenly stopped taking them so I’m trying to just remain calm and as level headed as I can but I need some advice on how to feel okay until I can get them"
I didn't know with how much anxiety I deal,"So I got pregabalin for my anxiety and Im planning to only take it on weekends but god I swear there is a difference already. I actually can sit still and do things like reading a book. Which was really hard for so many years for me. They did never treat my anxiety, finally someone is hearing me. I feel so much relief"
Can medication cause acne?,I know they can but atm I'm not 100% sure if it's my age (22 soon 23) or just the meds. I know normal acne can be around till the age of 25 so I'm not sure. Acne is kind of a real problem for me cause it makes me so insecure and also kinda makes me feel I'm ugly .-.
Looking for advice/ perspective,"I was just diagnosed. I’m not medicated for bipolar yet but am for ADHD, anxiety and depression."
I see it coming.,
Hey I need to tell someone this,
Quitting smoking,I just quit smoking IQOS which has 5% of Nicotine than a normal cigarette has. I’m scrolling through Reddit and I’m reading that quitting smoking caused people to have manic episodes ? Wtf even when I want to do something good for my health there must be something bad coming What’s your experience with quitting?
There is hope in this disorder particularly if you get your med combo right,I’m on lithium and vraylar BP 1 with psychosis and I was hospitalized 14 times and now I’m doing well. The side effects have largely dissipated too. I was a med student years ago and I can tell that I can again be successful with this regimen. The vraylar keeps me from psychosis and the lithium stabilizes additionally my mood.
High dose lithium,I’ve been on 1800mg of lithium for about 6 years and my levels are consistently around .5 or .6. It’s the only thing that’s helped control my mood and all of my other kidney and liver levels are fine but psychiatrists are always surprised by my levels given the high dosage. Has anyone else experienced this?

What does everyone do for work?/How do you survive?,"I feel like this question has been asked a lot but I can’t find any threads/don’t know what to look for. Basically w being bipolar and having memory issues (related to the BP) I can’t keep a job without leaving due to some mental health crisis. I am educated but I can’t get jobs that pay more than minimum wage (definitely not a living wage) and I’m just wondering how you do it? I’ve gone to employment agencies and they still can’t help me get better jobs because even though I’ve never been fired, I still haven’t stayed at more places more than 6 months. Any tips/personal stories appreciated! Thanks!"
does anyone else get overstimulated?,"i’m diagnosed w BP1 and quite a few other conditions. I’ve been thinking that i might just be autistic though. Anyways, i always have to carry my noise canceling headphones w me.. especially in grocery stores. When i’m out in public and i hear noise it really stresses me out and makes me insanely anxious. But as soon as a turn off that noise i’m completely fine. Does anyone else get like this? 😭😭 i’m trying to figure out what condition makes me like this."
Social Media,"I deleted my Instagram a few months ago and it’s been great not worrying about people perceiving me/judging me as well as comparing myself to others. I then got really addicted to Tik Tok and I’d just stare at my phone for hours on end which was very depressing. I deleted it a few days ago and I’ve been so productive since!!! It’s nice not getting sucked into my phone. If you’ve never tried it, I suggest you give it a go!"
Forget to hydrate when working at the computer? I've cracked the code.,"If you're like me, one of the things I struggle with is staying hydrated. Basic needs are always unmet with my Bipolar. I usually hit 50% of my water goal if I'm actively trying to get as much as possible. On days where I don't care, I can consume literally no water."
Longest time you were in the mental health facility aka psych ward?,What was your experience like? Was it scary? Did you see any unexplainable scary things? I stayed up for four days and went insane. I was also smoking very potent marijuana constantly. Zero meds. Went insane and attacked cops
The Constant Urge To Up and Quit,"Any advice on this? This pertains to a lot of aspects in my life, more often than not my job and where I live. I've come to terms with the fact I need to work to survive, I like my job and the pay is great... it's even remote work from home so it's not like anything is holding me down. But I just always want to quit. For no reason. I'd regret it 10-fold if I quit. I don't know if this is a discipline game or if I need further help with impulse control but I am STRUGGLING. It's a ""book of business"" sort of job but waiting for the seeds to grow is really tearing my bipolar mind apart. As far as living situation - I'm in a good spot, again, nothing tying me down and I know logically if I moved I'd feel the same way 3 months later. Any advice on how you guys handle this is very much welcome."
i’m all over the place,
What's something good that you've recently done for your mental health?,"I cut off a really toxic friend a couple weeks ago. I did it calmly & respectfully, something I would have struggled with greatly a few years ago. During my darkest days, I would have lost my cool & then spiraled, maybe ended up in the hospital a couple weeks after. This time was different. I told her how I felt & that I've been stable for 3 years & could not afford to be part of a toxic dynamic. I wished her well. Then I blocked her. I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. I also felt a sense of pride because I know this entire scenario would have played out very differently just a few short years ago."
What are you up to tonight?,"I was trying to make it an early night as I have a ton of stuff I need to get done this weekend that I have been putting off but I can’t sleep. Feeling all over the place today. So, what are you up to? How are you spending your Friday night?"
are the things you desire during a manic episode real?,everytime i’m hypomanic i start wanting to learn a new language. first it was spanish and now japanese. also i always start new hobbies like baking. but when i crash i struggle to keep up with it and think i was delusional to even think i could do it
"Recently diagnosed, need advice",
Do you waste a lot of time thinking?,"Hiiii, so after my diagnosis and knowing that I have more facility to get addicted to things than others I decided to quit social media in general (still struggling with YouTube) and it helped me a lot, but now I'm noticing that the time that I would spend scrolling I'm thinking now, usually is just me creating scenarios in my head, but I'm doing it ALL DAY for HOURS and I do not get tired of it. Does anyone else have or had this? What do you do to deal with it? Because it's bothering me and it's disturbing me in the daily life."
"Let's have a positive change of pace for a moment. What is your favorite thing about being bipolar, or a side benefit?","My relationship with my family used to be very closed off. After I had my first serious mania last year, I had to really open up to my family and start using them as a support network. Now my relationship with my mom is better than it's ever been, and that is awesome."
I don’t want to exist,I have been overwhelmed and exhausted more so lately and it’s effecting my sleep and making it harder for me to feel like I want to exist . I don’t want to be dead but I don’t want to live . This is exhausting and I don’t get any help from my husband to make my life a little easier and we have a kiddo which is also exhausting. I’m just so exhausted. I feel like I never sleep or feel relaxed .
"I sacrifice a lot in relationships, and I regret it after","When it comes to relationships, I sacrifice a lot to satisfy the other person's needs, even if it means ignoring my own needs. I hate it, and I know it's not healthy. I'm trying to restrain myself from doing so, but it's hard because I care about the people in my life so much (maybe even more than myself) that I want to make them feel as comfortable as possible."
dont know where to say this,Do you sometimes feel that you dont really have friends and that everyone in your life is fake or dont really care at all? What happened was something my friends did tiggered me and I told them that its trigerring to me and they haven't spoken to me since
Hypo. Yay (sarcasm),Just figured out last night I was going hypo. Now I’m at work trying not to want to rip all my skin off. Trying to be a functional human being. This sucks.
Experiencing manic episode?,"Not sure how to flag: For those of you who have experienced elevated mood after introducing a higher dosage of antidepressants, what was the experience like?"
Advice on how to deal with Manic Hypersexuality?,"Hey guys, I think I am in the midst of a hypomanic episode and I am experiencing hypersexuality. I have been having unwanted sexual thoughts and urges. I have been masturbating more frequently than usual to deal with it but I don't want to hurt myself."
Song suggestions?,"Music helps my mood a lot, does it work that way with anyone else here? What are your favorite songs? Do you have certain melodies to help you be more positive, or to just cope with things?"
Depressed but not sad?,
Am I just hypomanic and being paranoid? I’m afraid that the people at my car’s dealership snooped through my backpack when I was out of the room. Should I call them to see if they’ll let me review the security cameras?,"Today I went to pick up my car, which has been at the dealership for a month. I sat with the customer service manager in his office (a conjoined desk next to another conjoined desk and a side office), and waited for my parents (who helped pay for the service) to send paperwork."
Do you miss things a lot? Maybe too much?,"I'm driving around my college town, and it's been about seven years but I come back often enough. I just find myself at an intersection and I think one thing I miss (dog sitting a friend's dog for a weekend), then I think of another (driving to the lake for a date and the Neil Young song we were listening to), or the time a guy lit up at a party after a long week and gave me a big hug, or the dance hall we could walk to, and on and on. I miss the mural that's been painted over on the building downtown, and the Indian restaurant that closed, and my good friend who worked at the bookstore who moved up North. The college farm I worked at is still there, and the coffee shop manager still runs the joint I used to work at, and my former professor still hosts poetry nights each week. I just wonder what I'm holding onto, and why. How much has to do with my bipolar, and how much is just getting older."
(Diagnosis Pending) Just Had a Manic Episode for the First Time,"So I came out of a manic delusional episode like a couple weeks ago and am now seeing a therapist who said that until I officially get diagnosed, they'd be treating me as if I had bipolar. I don't know how to feel and I don't know how to deal with the fallout of the episode, as I also experienced some hallucinations/psychosis symptoms that have significantly alienated me from peopl in my life especially family."
Any other college students struggling to graduate?,
Ups and downs,"Anyone else have a day when you feel bright, make plans for yourself and your future that seem doable, energized, overall better outlook, positive interactions with others… … followed by a day where you realize there is no way in hell you can take it all on and basically feel like you just want to disappear because you hate yourself and can’t stand one more second in your own skin?"
"It's hard knowing what ""normal"" is supposed to feel like.","I've been medicated for going on 4 or so months now, I'm currently on Vraylar but I just don't think it's working right.  It's just so difficult to know what's wrong and what's ""normal."""
Quitting smoking triggering severe depressive episode,Has anyone else experienced something like this? I'm wondering if there are any tips or tricks to overcome this. I'm thinking about quitting soon and have made some attempts but have always gone back to smoking because of the way it either triggers a severe depressive or manic episode.
Everything bad happens all at once,
Qoute I found on the internet,"Yes you have a mood disorder, but don't let anyone ever use that as a reason to blame you for a relationship going askew. People can be jacked without a diagnosis and some times people will place blame on you because you do have a disorder or try to make you the scapegoat for something going wrong. Yeah, maybe you'll blow up out of rage and you will be to blame sometimes, but you are not always to blame!"
(Diagnosis Pending) Doctor said might be bipolar out of the blue,"I just went to my first appointment with my new PCP, and halfway through the appointment, we started discussing mental health history and medications. I said I had taken Zoloft (50mg) six months prior but had discontinued it after four days (doctor's orders) due to extreme hallucinations, no sleep the entire four days, and overall just erratic/ecstatic behavior. He pointed out to me that SSRIs can bring out manic episodes, and with my family history, there is a possibility I could be bipolar (Obviously not a diagnosis and he even stressed that was just his first impression of my history and what I told him). Up until this point I never even knew what bipolar really was or even considered the possibility that I had it. When he told me it was kind of surreal in an uncomfortable way. He gave me a brief overview of the symptoms and signs of bipolar and I could relate to a lot of it. So after we were finishing up he said he wanted to follow up on this, and he was surprised my previous doctor didn't do anything when that ""Zoloft event"" happened (that's why I switched doctors in the first place). This all just came out of the left field and honestly don't know what to think."
Question about Lamictal,Can somebody who has bee/is on Lamictal tell me if this is normal?
Mood Swings Lasting Hours,"So I know that most people associate rapid mood swings with borderline personality disorder- which I have been diagnosed with- but the strange thing is that these rapid mood swings are responsive to medication. As soon as I take my medication, the mood swings just stop. My understanding is that borderline personality disorder is, for the large part, unresponsive to medication(s)."
weird shift work— any stories?,"title. i just started a job at a package facility, 4 days a week 4am-8am. Right now i’m sleeping from ~9:30-3:30 and then from 8:30-11:00."
Infatuation rather than hyperfixation?,"A little other two months ago, I was put on a new medication along with an increase in my tried and true antidepressant. I was told it was to help my focus, which it does! It also curbs my hyperfixation. Shortly after, I began talking to a new potential partner and I’m finding it almost strange… I’m not obsessed. Since the age of 14, I’ve fixated on crushes and partners to the point of being called “obsessed”. And now I find myself confused on how much I actually like my new potential partner after 2 months of “talking”. Normally, I’d be lost in fantasies by this point. I know I like him enough to spend each weekend we can together(both single parents) and look forward to lots of new experiences with him. Anyway…."
Hey out of the ordinary good news,"While at work I had a lead for my shift ask if I myself was interested in being a lead
(a lead being a ""semi-manager"" ~ handles immediate managerial issues but does not manage schedules and other big picture managerial issues)"
Does it ever get better?,(long post)
"marriage, pregnancy, meds","Hi friends, I have bp1 w a history of psychosis (amongst other things/illnesses as well)"
Therapy +/- meds:,"Out of curiosity, particularly because we’re all experiencing things differently and also, all over the world! I am just curious as to what we are all offered in our own countries in terms of treatment and medication (eg. Is medication at the forefront of your treatment or do you have therapy etc)"
Bipolar + borderline,"Recently I went to the psychiatrist. She said I'm doing fine... really fine. She said that on the other times I went to her I was ""laughing with no reason"", I was ""crying with no reason"", I went there hopeless and I went there pretty energetic. She met me on January, when I was on mania. This time, she said I was the more stable she has ever saw me. And then we talked about that borderline stuff. She said she thinks I got some borderline characteristics. She explained me some differences between both disorders, and I went like ""ok... I think I got it"""
I’m fucking miserable,
Finally Diagnosed :),"After so long of struggling and trying to find a reason for everything I've finally been diagnosed with bipolar and have been given meds, I know that there's still so much work to do before everything can get to a better place but I'm so excited to finally start the process of being in control of my life again. :)"
I shouldn't have studied psychology.,"I'm a clinical psychologist with Bipolar II and I fucking shouldn't have become a therapist. I hate myself. I'm studying a masters and I'm fucking done with everything. I should've studied something else, how can I help others when I can't even help myself?????"
Tips for Motivation,"I really need to clean but since getting on medication, I find that I don’t clean as well as I use to when I was experiencing mania.  I also use to be more on top of other tasks like completing assignments and budgeting. What’s some good tips that you use to get some motivation going?"
i lost my job…,i lost my job today (or at least i’ll get paid for 6 weeks until my contract ends but it’s effectively the same).
Does the psych or doctor prescribe the meds?,
What are some of the best informational videos about bipolar disorder that you've come across?,"I'm looking for something informational that could help people close to me better understand my condition and how it affects my daily life. I'd really like some suggestions for videos that are educational, but also a bit entertaining. Have any of you seen any videos that have stuck with you, or that you've shown to someone else?"
Is it depression? Is it manic irritability? A mixed episode on the horizon or just PMDD?,"Since mid April I’ve been in a new job that I really love. There were a couple minor hiccups between then and now, but overall things are great. Back in April I started seeing a new doctor because my psychiatrist of 10 years proved to me that I am now a number and not a patient. Dumb healthcare. I love this new doctor because she’s female and she’s been able to see my disorder through the added lens of being postpartum which can make make a child bearing person have more intense and more frequent mood episodes between birth to 4 years, most regulate their hormones by the 2 year mark. Well, with her I went back on a low dose of Adderall for my ADHD and prior to that we’ve decreased my Depakote from 750 to 500mg. All my other meds have stayed the same. I was fine and feeling stable until this week. This week I’ve been extremely fatigued in the morning, poor concentration, dealing with a lot of PMS symptoms for the last 2 weeks, and my anxiety is bordering on odd mild paranoia but only with regard to work. Lastly, I’ve just felt overall down."
I’m at my lowest mentally yet I’m doing my best work right now.,"I’ve been in a really bad spot mentally for the last week yet I’m doing the best I have ever done at my job. I can feel I’m putting on the fakest of fake smiles when at work but it’s working. People believe I’m doing better than ever. Is this normal for bipolar? Now, my job is unique. I’m a real estate photographer so I just put in my AirPods and take photos of houses. The job involves minimal communication and I have no boss overseeing me. But the photos I’m taking right now are getting extreme praise from realtors/customers. They are calling the office and telling them I’m the best photographer they have gotten with the company. Anyways I just find it interesting because I’m smoking more weed than ever and on the verge of a grippy sock vacay. Fortunately, I’m going to try to get sober today. I’ve had many attempts in the past and my longest being 30 days about a month ago. I’m just curious to why I’m doing so good even though I’m collapsing internally."
Blend,Asphyxiated on life
Tfw your real life makes you sound absolutely insane,"I was in a deteriorating mental hospital and the Doctor that I saw twice called me in. He asked me where I lived to which I responded in Boat in a completely different state. Explaining that while I was a California resident I spent most of my time in Oregon. The doctor then replied that I just ""wasted ten minutes of my time."" And walked out."
Picked up a new hobby with my mania energy,
First day in the psych ward & there’s a live concert in the common room… what?,"It’s my first day today in the psych ward and they’ve got a pianist and singer playing live music! Never thought I’d see this in a psych ward, but I guess I’m not so surprised given the fact that I live in Denmark. It’s just wild how different psych wards are in Scandinavian countries compared to places like England and America, generally (going off of the experiences I’ve read on here). I feel like it’s odd though, cause a psych ward is usually a place I come to for peace and balancing myself. Kinda sweet though"
Does anyone else do this?,
What's the difference between Genomind and Tempus?,"My new pdoc ordered a Tempus test, and my old pdoc was against Genomind when offered for being primitive and inaccurate. I'm on 900mg Li and fine with it, what could Tempus do that would justify the $100 OOP?"
Just venting,"I called to schedule an appointment with my med doc today and found out he is no longer with the clinic. I hate having to go through intake again, but more than anything I am upset I wasn't told. He helped me so much through my separation last year and I can't believe I won't see him again. Just wanted to vent to people who will understand."
I’m so tired of this,"I have been fighting this shit for most of my life unmedicated, but at the beginning of this year I had a horrific breakup, spiraled completely down after doing decently well for the 3 years we were together. I was having depression and mania of course, and I finally was prescribed something and had hopes of it working. I have been on seroquel for about 2 months now and I no longer experience mania but I am just extremely depressed. I cannot seem to get it to stop. Depression has followed me since I was a child and I’m always back in this spot, and it’s always worse with each major stressor that has happened to me. I always believed it couldn’t get worse, and somehow it has. Now I am just existing in this state of overwhelming depression. I can’t find happiness in many things and I just feel stuck. I have been fighting it for years and years now and it’s so exhausting. In 5 months I’ve lost 40 pounds and I just can’t eat most of the time. I guess all I wonder if things will get better. Anymore I try to not talk about it with anyone because I don’t want to keep acknowledging how bad it is. No matter how much I talk about it, it just doesn’t help. I don’t want to be suffering at 21, I don’t want this."
Life really doesn’t get better,"I have been diagnosed bipolar for over 20 years. Here’s the last year or two. It’s really starting to get to be a struggle. I’ve had to change my medication a little bit just to get sleep and just to get out of bed. I’ve been grinding my teeth so much that I’ve developed bone growth that I’ve had to have an oral surgeon drained out of my mouth. My home life is miserable, bouncing where I should stand up for myself or go back into my bubble. I have a new therapist, but with my new Medicare plan, I can only see her once every three weeks I know I know the answer, but what can I do to get out of my funk?"
I'm about to lose my career because I take medication,"It works really well to keep me stable but the side effects include memory loss and brain fog. My job is very technical and requires a highly functioning brain. Every med I have tried does this. I worked very hard to get into this field, I feel heartbroken that it won't work out because of my bipolar."
Do you have a fear of parenthood? Or how you’ll behave?,21F I can honestly say my biggest goal in life is to be a wife and a mother. I know that is not the life for everyone but I dream of it always. Everything I work for now is for the future of myself and my future children
No one will ever like me or understand me,"At 30, I've realized for a while people won't ever want to stick around me because, no matter what I've tried, they go away. I don't matter. Nobody has a clue about me. No one affords me the respect to try to understand me."
Is this considered a hallucination?,"I have been feeling pretty hypomanic lately. I take 50mg of Lam XR for a year. I have been pretty stable for about a year. That is, until 1 week ago which was the exact same time I had an episode last year!"
Suggested accomodations to my employer for ADA,"I disclosed my illness to my employer. My doctor wrote a letter of diagnosis and a statement about how bipolar/OCD affects my ability to work. He only said that it caused me to have variations in my ability to concentrate -- I can focus sometimes in great detail, and sometimes not."
Between episodes,"My bp episodes are well managed with meds and therapy, but I still struggle in between episodes. I feel very sensitive and get overwhelmed reasonably easily. How do other people experience life between episodes?"
Do any of you also get paranoid delusions?,First off I think this is a sign that I need to up my meds or switch to a new antipsychotic.
My (F23) boyfriend (M23) told me he can't take another two months of our relationship because of my mental health,"Hi all,"
My therapist told me I was depressed. I had no idea.,
Last night I discovered my passion for sketching,
My therapist just told me he quit and today was his last day. No warning,"Pretty much what the title says. I've been at this one office for all my psych services for years. Over a decade. When covid hit my first therapist quit saying she was burned out. So I got my 2nd therapist. She was great. Then she went on maternity leave, so I got switched to my 3rd therapist. When my 2nd therapist came back I was switched back to her. Then my 2nd therapist moved out of state because her husband got transfered. OK. Well the 3rd therapist I had no longer had room for me on her schedule so I was sent to a 4th therapist. He seemed cool, stuck around for a year. Last session he canceled.l because he had covid. Today at the end of our session he dropped the bomb. He got a new job elsewhere and today was our last session. I don't know who my new (and 5th!) therapist will be now. Could take a month or longer to get reassigned."

Acceptance,"My type 1 bipolar became rapid cycling a year and a half ago and since then, I have had no periods of stability lasting longer than a fortnight. Before rapid cycling, I would have manias about once every 2 years and be depressed or stable, sometimes stable for 6 months or more. Since rapid cycling, I've had about 8 hypomanias and 3 severe manias, been hospitalised 6 times, sent to crisis houses, many meds changes, therapy, ECT.... Nothing is working any more. Lithium used to work a charm for a long time, suddenly it just stopped. I think it was related to me having my youngest kid but I don't know. My team have provided me with carers because it's become clear I can no longer function living alone and need help. They have said that rapid cycling is rarely permanent, but it's often treatment resistant. They can't help me any more, there are no options left. They have told me to consider practicing acceptance - that this is just how things are and I need to learn how to live with it and around it. To accept I have a significant disability that affects my life deeply. But with that I can also accept that when I'm depressed, it will pass soon enough, and what's waiting for me at the end of that hellscape, is the outright bliss of mania. The cycle continues. I'm upset because I'm losing my sense of self - I'm never stable any more, I'm forgetting who I am. Maybe I need to accept that this is who I am, sometimes the volume is turned up, sometimes I'm on mute. In rehab my counsellor said ""do you let your illness define you?"", And I said ""yes, and I have to accept that. That is a thought that keeps me alive"". Anyway just wanted to share."
Hello from the psych ward,
have to rehome my dog due to my bipolar,so unbelievably sad and hurt right now. I feel like a failure because i cannot keep up with him and his needs. I just get so depressed that I can’t even move out of bed and I feel so guilty but I know there is someone who can take care of him like he deserves to be taken care of. I honestly just need support right now.
Tips for Managing Unmedicated BP1,"I have an appointment with a psychiatrist but it isn't for a couple of months. I've been unmedicated for almost a year now and it's catching up to me fast. I can feel myself becoming a worse friend, partner, and person, and I really want for it to stop. Any tips would be greatly appreciated."
New Here,Hello! I have been recently diagnosed with bipolar 2 and I really can’t bring myself to start medication. I don’t even know where to start because of all of the different medications the doctor listed off. The thought of medication is nauseating.
Make,Throw me in
Being forced to change meds for no reason.,"When I moved 3 years ago I got a new psychiatrist.  He writes prescriptions for the medications that I was already taking before he was my Dr… He has never had to change my medication because I’ve been fine for years. I called him because I feel a little hypo. It’s not that bad… some racing thoughts and and feeling a bit overwhelmed. My husband told me that he does not think I am hypomanic, so it’s in no way an emergency…. In the past when this happened I always take 2 extra mg of Abilify until I feel better. It works every time... My new psychiatrist said this is not how he wants to handle it and now he wants to change/add/ and take me off some of my current medications. I don’t know what to do? This could potentially make things worse. Anything he tries is an experimentation. I am having a hard time understanding why he won’t try what I know works first. It took me forever to find the correct doses and medications. I am in shock that he wants to change so much."
Anyone have links to articles about Sensory Input as a coping mechanism?,I've been dealing with mental illness a long time. To the point I know a lot that I couldn't provide a link to.

My cocktail: Remission achieved,"I've never posted here before, but I just got my prior auth for another year of rx, and I was just thinking that I'd share my cocktail in case in helps anyone. Background Bipolar NOS (also ADHD... maybe one manic episode, mostly hypomanic ones when they were in that range. Most of the disorder has been mixed depression, but I was always medicated with something, so i truly don't know how my natural state is."
Is there a healthy balance between keeping some creativity and feeling the necessary boredom?,"In other words is it supposed to suck? I got on it a while ago and I felt completely and utterly powerless and helpless, no motivation, no nothing. Could have been trauma from coming from a psych ward, but is it meant to be like this? Or can there be a balance?"
I'm new here and confused.,I don't even know where to start.
Embarrassed myself at work and need help,I embarrassed myself with my behavior and not sure what to do. I work for a large consulting firm as a senior consultant. The last project I was on was not my finest moment.

Universal Health Care ---> length of psych ward stay???,I am curious about the length of your stay(s) in a psychiatric ward if you live in a country with universal health care.
I was diagnosed this week with BP 2 and it’s hit me like a truck. I stumbled across this scene from “Modern Love” and it’s exactly what I needed to see. Hope it brings you some comfort too if you’re struggling.,
Can’t stop manic stealing…help!,"I’ve been stealing a LOT lately (grocery stores, my job - small food shop, anywhere I have to pay for things) and I can’t seem to stop. It’s a manic compulsion at this point. I’m bipolar 1 and well medicated (Wellbutrin, lexapro, depakote)and smoke a copious amount of weed for my social anxiety (it’s legal in my state). I seem to only steal from my job when I’m sober. When I smoke I realize I’m an idiot and worry about getting fired."
Uncomfortable explaining mania to people,"It’s so hard reconnecting with people I abandoned during a manic episode. How do I explain i went MIA because I thought everyone including my own mother was a demon in a human costume and that the entire universe is a simulation designed to torture me? I was on another level of reality baby, can’t remember a single thing about what was happening in this one in my mental absence but want to read this 50,000 word paper I wrote in 2 days on how the archetypal symbols found on tarot cards is the key to understanding the human mind??"
When does motivation come back after full mania,"Had a manic/psychotic episode in Nov/Dec of last year and I feel a lot better than I have been, but I’m still feeling so confused as to what to do with my time. It’s as if my natural drive has vanished. I just want to be able to do simple things, but the ease and flow of life is gone. Things like watching tv, cooking, hobbies. I can work just fine but that’s the only thing I do. I miss putting on boiling water for pasta and thinking “I’ll go and watch a YouTube video while this heats up”. That sort of behavior is gone. My days off are spent wandering around in this confused state, sometimes listening to music if I’m interested enough. I try my hobbies almost every day but I feel no connection. Does it come back? I just feel really lost sometimes and like my life is gone forever."
I'm not okay,"About 3 weeks ago I went to the psychiatrist urgency with beginning of a psychotic break, my lithium levels were very low, almost 0. They gave me a lot of drugs and my psychiatrist prescribed me more. I was so fucking manic, like very severe and know with this new meds I feel a lot of things, my body is much calm (which is very good) but my head is a mess, I feel fucking depressed, I have a lot of mood swings, I get irritated so easily. I want to sh so much, I relapsed a couple times in this past weeks."
Scuba diving and bipolar,A couple of years before my diagnosis I got my advanced open water and logged about 50 dives. I haven't dove since.
I’m f***ed up for life!,
Bipolar Diagnosis,"I (29M) was recently diagnosed with bipolar, but I’m not exactly bipolar one or two, my doctor put my condition on the outside of the two kind of like a third option, of sorts."
"Something in the air, or my missed-meds brain???","Multiple exes are contacting me out of nowhere, after years? Changing profile pics to resemble mine? I’m happily married for 7 years… is mercury in retrograde or am I making random connections or what???"
How to snap out of mania?,So for some reason every 3-6 months I have a episode or I guess habit where I get super lonely and stay up till 3 or 4am even if I work or have something to do the next day.
Am I the only bipolar nerd that gets manic after reading a good book?,"Seriously, my heart is racing, I’m talking faster than normal, I feel like I just ate a bowl of sugar."
I Feel My Life is a Unique Hell.,"I’m male, 22.  I have my life very together, all but romantically.  The initial feelings I get for someone are strong, and those feelings make my mind spiral out of control.  Every time this happens my illness fucks something up and rips them away from me."
Can anyone explain what the hell happened?,"I'm not even sure if this was a bipolar symptom at all, but it started out like one, so... Would just love some insight! I'd been depressed for about five weeks and have developed a bit of a drinking problem as well. I had a hangover yesterday, so I didn't drink at all, but was feeling pretty crap the whole day. I had been up watching a show until past midnight, which after I told myself I had to try and sleep now—I had the prospect of going to work tomorrow, so I didn't want to sleep (I'd taken a few weeks off and was trying to force myself back—idek why because I didn't have to) but as I went to bed, I didn't feel so tired (even though I only had around six hours of sleep that day, which is not enough for me typically) and then I started talking to myself. A lot. I ended up talking about whether I'd prefer a dishwasher or a dry cleaner and all of the pros and cons to both and many other things I don't remember. Naturally, I'm thinking I'm coming out of my depressive episode and into hypomania."
Intrusive thoughts or auditory hallucinations?,
Executive Dysfunction,Is it even possible for my pdoc to prescribe me some medication for executive dysfunction without an assessment?
Went blind with rage and keyed someone’s car very badly and my rage episode just ended,"I (19m) had been fishing for 5 hours hadn’t eaten all day and was running on not much sleep, smoked some cones before fishing and bad 2 beers on boat (I hardly ever drink). I get back to the boat ramp in the dark, tie my boat up, walk up to get my car and trailer to find that someone had illegally parked in front of my car in the specifically signed “cars with trailers and boats only” when I was very clearly taking up the whole long parking space and it’s pretty obvious you can’t park in front of someone with no way for them to get out. Every other spot In the section was also illegally parked leaving me with no way out essentially stranded with my boat in the water and no way home. (My licence is also currently suspended but the ramp is a 5 min drive so I wasn’t worried about getting caught)."
What are good jobs for people with bipolar?,I have both bipolar and severe anxiety and had to call out of my fast food job today due to having a severe mental breakdown mixed with a panic attack. What are some good jobs for people with bipolar? I don't think my mind can handle the pace and stress of fast food anymore.
clippers ran out of battery in the middle of my impulsive head shave,"so now i get to sit around for a couple of hours with a small chunk of my head shaved. even then it’s going to take forever cause they’re not really clippers, it’s an electric body razor lol. it’s getting the job done though. i can’t buy the regular clippers cause i spent all my money on bleach, developer, hair dye, thinning shears, special shampoo, conditioner, and of course getting tons and tons of comfort food delivered. i’ll give you one guess as to what mental state im in right now. i keep catching glimpses of myself in the mirror and thinking well, at least i look as crazy as i feel. im guessing some days i’ll regret the shaved head but right now it feels like the most liberating thing in the world and i can’t wait to be done. the tiny patch i managed to get done feels so soft."
New hobby: Acquired 🎯 What's your latest endeavor?,
New psych is awesome but med rant,"I saw a new psych and she is really lovely I can’t wait to see what we can do together, my panic attacks and just general anxiety have gotten worse over the last six months and she prescribed me robaxin which helped wonderfully the first day but when I took it again today I felt no relief :/ and leaded me to having a panic attack at work , I called my new psych and let her know. I’m just so worried I won’t be able to find something that isn’t benzodiazepines to help:/ which I’m not going to ask for outright I filled out some pre paperwork saying what I’ve tried that’s worked for me before. Idk I just feel like treating anxiety is a losing battle or my brain is just further broken from bipolar."
What were you like before taking your first psychiatric pill?,I had a depressive episode and social anxiety that prevented me from attending school. I isolated myself from all my friends. There would be periods of times where I had so much energy and would be extra. I got extremely irritated at certain people. I started experiencing mental symptoms at age 15.
I don’t know,i genuinely just don’t understand how i’ve been feeling and that is so agitating. one moment i’m fine the next i’m freaking out that i’m all alone
Can people with BP be triggered like people with other mental illnesses?,Hi. I'm the guy whose wife wants me to quit this sub because she's worried I'll be triggered into a depression.
This mixed episode is trying to destroy me,
Inner voice,"When I take the time to pause and listen to my inner voice, I only hear uninspiring and discouraging words. My heart doesn’t long for anything, nor does it want anything from life. So I keep things superficial, distract myself, and do what I can on the day to day."
So is there a chance for us at a happy ending?,"I have read so many stories of broken relationships and struggling relationships and stories of how loved ones are pushed to the brink and have given up bc it’s just too much to deal with us. Some days I feel like I’m just getting worse and worse. Do we have a chance at happiness? Do we get to stay in a relationship without driving out SO to the brink? I had what I thought was one of the strongest loves I’ve ever known. I don’t just mean me personally, I mean growing up, friends, family. We had a special connection and trust that just seemed too good to be true. Then it just got too hard for him when things got hard and I went into depression. After feeling miserable for at least 2 years, he decided he deserved a chance at happiness and left me. Now he’s in a new house, promoted, has a new girlfriend and all is right in his world. He found his happiness in 4 months. I’m left wondering how he could leave me at my worst knowing my struggles. I also have massive guilt from thinking he went without happiness bc he loved me that much. Is this what we’re destined for? Is this selfish? I know some of you are still capable of learning new things and starting over. I’m being forced to start over but I really don’t think I have the cognitive ability to learn a new job with any success. I’m hoping/praying it’s just the depression from divorce and job loss. I’m in a dark place right now. Someone please tell me something good."
Hypomania episode,"I’m coming out of (in the midst of) a hypomanic episode and I feel like quitting my job and moving to a farm so I can spend my days moving my body in fresh air instead of driving myself crazy as an exec assistant glued to my computer. Talk me out of/into it, please. Thank you 🩷🤕🤪😢❤️"
My psych says I should use a mood tracking app. Which?,"Basically, psychiatrist wants me to start with a daily mood tracking app but she doesn't have any she prefers. Do you use one you like? I'm Bipolar II with frequent depression so need to be able to record when I'm low and normal-feeling. Also, I respond well to DBT."
This shits exhausting,"That's it that's all i got. Feel normal for a year boom back to square 1. Feel suicidal for a year boom not so fast lets try to save the world. End up in the hospital not knowing my name, 3 days later I'm teaching people shit I can barely remember the minute I walk out the door. Therapist says weed is great for me, psych says it's very bad for all bipolar people and antidepressants are the next step (should've known i was taking the stairs). My brains melting I am puddle, anybody got a mop?"
"That in-between ""mixed"" phase where you're not manic or depressed... Let's talk about how weird it is","I was diagnosed with bipolar early this year. I have known for probably a decade but never admitted it to myself, nor sought out help."
Late night walks by the beach 🌙,
Australian medication problem,Hey everyone.  If anyone is from Australia and have you experienced this. In regional areas and rural areas the current change in legislation by government is making it harder for medication to get to our areas. This is due to being able to get in bulk medication I believe. This sounds good but my pharmacist says he can only get me certain brands due to the fact of the shortages now. Pharmacist are struggling to get many medications now.
I made the honor roll!,"I just got an email that I made the honor roll for the spring semester and I am so beyond proud of myself! Between going on and off meds and a major depressive episode, after I took my last final I was genuinely too scared to look at my grades and see how I finished up. I was worried that going back to school was just a manic decision and I’d fade out, it took me a bit to fully realise I’d actually applied. Gives me so much hope that I will actually be able to finally get my degree!"
Episodes outside of regular episodes,Hello. I need some help with something. I’m going to speak to my therapist about this as well but in the meantime I wanted to see if anyone else experiences this as well.
I think my psychiatrist is ignoring me,"I have I only have two of my anti-psychotics left my psychiatrist hasn’t sent in a refill even though it was supposed to be a 3 month refill. I’ve called her and have left a voicemail and asked CVS to reach out to her for another refill and no one has gotten in touch with her. It’s been a week and I haven’t gotten in touch with her, neither could my pharmacy. I’m trying not to panic but I know the consequences of missing multiple days of my medication. I’m worried about what will happen to me if this doesn’t get resolved soon. Any advice could I go to another doctor and get an emergency refill I don’t know what to do."
How do you know when you’re in a mixed episode? What do they feel like to you?,"For the past week or so, things have gone like this:"
Very scared to start vraylar,I’m very scared to start vraylar. I’ve had such bad side effects on antipsychotics and mood stabilizers and they just never seemed to work or worked too well.
Bipolar disability,Has anyone been approved for disability pay FROM WORK for bipolar? My family member is severely depressed and about to quit. I’d rather them take a leave of absence. Thank you in advance!!!
Feeling lost and frustrated with myself,"I'm  sure there are many threads like this, so I'll try my best to keep  things brief. But we'll see how that pans out, as the situation is a bit  of a doozy. Or perhaps, the much-feared combination of doozies. A  multi-doozy epoch, if you will."
Manic or Happy?,"I was wondering how everyone is able to distinguish the difference between their (hypo)manic and just happy moods? I've been doing some reckless things, have tons of energy, and feel good but I also recently restarted an old medication that used to give me more energy as well. So I'm pretty confused. Any help is appreciated!"
Vaping and mania???,Does anybody have first-hand experience  on this?
I love my job but my psychotic bipolar symptoms are making it miserable for me.,"I’m an audio engineer and was very lucky to get the only paid studio internship that I’m aware exists in my city. I love it, but the only tough thing is that I work the late night shift where I’ll administer the last couple sessions and lock up the studio. I’m the last person to leave the building. In any setting, I cannot stand to be alone. It makes me super paranoid to the point where I start having auditory and visual hallucinations. I’ve been here for a long time and haven’t told my superiors about this, because fortunately/unfortunately, I’m very high functioning. But I’m so tired of being terrified up here, it’s turning something that I love into an exhausting experience. I do have a second job which is actually where most of my income comes from, but not enough to support me, so I’m not in a position to drop either job right now."
How to stop feeling suicidal?,
Regular irrational thought or delusional? And what do I do?,"I know this sounds crazy, and I feel crazy for this thought returning over and over, but even after telling myself it’s not logical or probably possible, I keep thinking that my ex is communicating his love for me with static or making my tv glitch. Has this crossed the line from a regular irrational thought into the realm of delusions? And what the hell do I do about it?"
I finally feel like there is hope for a normal life with my new diagnosis,"I’ve spent every waking moment the last many years feeling like I was never going to have a semblance of a normal life. Like the happy moments weren’t worth it because the sad ones were so heavy and brutal. Like I couldn’t enjoy when I felt okay because the inevitable crash was looming over me. I felt like I would never find someone who would love me enough to deal with my weeks of not being able to get out of bed, or brush my teeth, or wear a clean shirt. My depression had stolen all of my hope."
Bipolar impulses,"Does anyone else have impulses for spending or other things where they have to have something so badly and if not you fall into a deep depression? If so, how do you handle those impulses to not act on them and not fall into a depression?"
mixed episodes tips?,"Hellooo i’m in my first mixed episode and i’m wondering if anyone has any tips, especially for the excessive yawning when i’m not tired 😭😭 i think the worst part about being hypomanic/mixed is the anxiety for some reason i can’t get negative emotions out of my head. Sorry for the mini rant! hope y’all are having a good day:))"
Feeling very alone,"I’m just wondering if anyone is in the same position as I am. I’ve been struggling a lot with depression and alcohol use. I drink to feel happy but then the next day I feel depressed, so it’s a never ending cycle. I have no friends my family lives far. We don’t have the money to visit them at this time. I’m a stay at home mom and it seems like my only friends are my kids. I honestly think I’m a functioning alcoholic and it makes sense because it does run in my family."
"Quetiapine, like an antidepressant, takes a few days to take effect in anxiety and depression?",Hey guys!
"Recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, struggling to process all that’s happened now that I’m discharged",I (22F) was diagnosed with bp1 after a psychotic/mixed episode landed me in the mental ward. It was a really confusing and terrifying experience because no one in the ward would explain to me why I was there and I didn’t know what psychosis meant on my intake form. I guess I was put on a hold? Or committed by the psychiatrist at the ER? The details are still really murky to me because this was the first time I had ever been full blown manic and I was like that for the week I was committed. Only when I was coming down did I realize that half of the people I thought I saw were visual hallucinations. To think I could be so detached from reality was traumatizing. I never experienced mania or psychosis before the hospitalization and only got a bipolar diagnosis when I was discharged and went to a psychiatrist unaffiliated with that hospital.
I think my job is trying to push me out. What do you think?,"Hey friends. I want to make sure I’m not having a severe emotional reaction by having fresh eyes view my situation. I tend to think people are rejecting me a lot, so I want to be sure I’m in the right…"
Getting back on social media,"I rejoined social media today (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter). I really just updated my profile pictures and bios, but it still made me feel very nervous and self conscious. I’ve been off social media (except Reddit) for many years. I was in a bad place for many years and couldn’t be on social media. I’m in a healthier place in many ways and ready to join back into the world, but I’m scared. Part of joining FB is to join some of the social groups that exist (there are groups in my city that organize details on FB and then meet up for events). I’m really hoping I can do this. I want to be a greater part of the world. I know this was super rambling. I think I just want some support and to hear if others have gone back on social media after a long break."
I’m a mess right now,My psych has prescribed me new meds- they are used to stop smoking but he thinks they might be effective for my mood. So it’s only been two days but last night my seventeen year old cat had to be put down. I was really close to him- he slept with me every night and sat on my lap when I was working from home. I feel awful and can’t tell what is from new medication and what is from grief. I just wanted to post on here for support. I know sometimes just having other people know what you’re going through helps and my mood is pretty low.
I've spent 2 years trying to understand how I got sick,"It's been 2 years and I still can't understand how I became sick nor can ai understand the things that happened during my psychosis all the SA, hospitalizations, psychiatrists, meds, etc"
"Newly diagnosed, on abilify for almost 2 weeks and I'm starving all the time",Does this side effect lessen with time? I'm trying my hardest not to eat whenever I feel that intense false hunger but it's really really hard and annoying. I'm on 15 mg abilify for 3 days. Before that I was working my way up from 5mg. Also I still get really irritable and sad in the evenings :( I hate this
Getting medboarded from the military,"So as the title suggests I’m getting medboarded from the Air Force for Bipolar 1. Honestly I’m excited and nervous about it because the military brings stability yet it’s very demanding on my mental health. I was told by my psychiatrist that usually she sees 70-100% VA but honestly I’m not sure whether to fully trust that or not. If anyone has been medboarded from the military I would love to talk in depth about it with someone so I know what I’m looking forward to/what to expect, because I have absolutely no clue how this works. I’ve done a little research on the VA rates, SSDI, and know very little about TDIU. Please help, I’m not sure what I should be looking to do, if I should be taking my leave or not, finding a new career path, how much do other people make with medical disability, etc… Thanks in advance to anyone who helps me out😅"
Taking seroquel for bipolar and just took a 4 hr nap,I do not take seroquel for sleep. I take it for bipolar disorder.
Collision,Sprint
favorite character representation of bipolar?,"mine is probably kat from spinning out, and her mom i cant remember her name. such a good representation, the whole show was such good represention. or rue from euphoria. all though euphoria glamorized addiction and mental illness i do think rues bipolar was represented pretty well."
"Cloudy headed, spaced out, can’t think clearly, and switch tasks in the middle of them.","This feeling comes and goes idk every few weeks or couple months. I cannot tell if it’s mania, depression, or just pure stress and anxiety. I’m diagnosed bipolar and also CPTSD and social anxiety."
Dating with Bipolar,"For those of you who have bipolar, when did you reveal to your partner you had bipolar disorder? How did you go about it? And how did your partner react/treat you afterwards?"
Zyprexa has made me feel dumber,Wondering if anyone else has experienced this. Ever since I started Zyprexa (10mg) about 2 months ago I just feel dumb. Its starting to effect my job in a really bad way. I am a software engineer and critical thinking is a big part of the job. Since being on Zyprexa it feels like I cant write code as efficiently as I once used to. I really don't like this at all. I want to get off this medicine so bad. Is this a permanent thing now? Am I always going to have this brain fog for the rest of my life now? I'm so scared.
Hypomanic and Hypersexual,
How to deal with a breakup,"I recently broke up with my girl, shits hard tho. I'm really bad at letting people go so I spent the last 2 weeks trying to get back because she said it was a maybe. It's completely over now but I carry on having the urge to message her and carry on trying even tho it's over I feel like theres something to do. We had a few arguments and I said some stuff that's not great and I feel awful and I wanna be able to move on, but I can't."
Just diagnosed,"I’m honestly so happy. I’ve been experiencing the cycles that come with BD for the past 6 months to a year, and it’s so odd because I knew something wasn’t right but I thought I was just tired, or drank too much coffee. Amongst many other odd symptoms of course. Then I mentioned it to my psychiatrist and she said what I’ve been experiencing is classic BD symptoms. I start my first dose of Lithium today, I’d love to hear everyone’s experience with Lithium. Seems to be a medication many people with BD have success with. Thank you in advance and I’m happy to find people who also have this! 💗"
i feel delicate?,"does anyone else feel like they kind of have to coddle themself? for context, i had my first big hypomanic episode this time last year and it took me a LONG time to get the right meds and get stable. (after two hospital visits and waayy too many med changes) now that i’m stable, i feel like i have to tip-toe around any triggers. i get terrified if i miss a couple hours of sleep or work too many days in a row. when i get tired i’m scared i’m getting depressed again, and when i’m anxious/happy i’m afraid the mania is coming back. i don’t feel like i can balance as many responsibilities as i used to either. as the months go on i feel like i’ve been able to stretch myself a little, but i’m kind of scared i’m gonna feel this delicate forever."
New Diagnosis,
Does anyone here work from home?,I really am having a hard time doing customer service/food service/retail right now and would really like to get into something where I can hide behind a computer on days when I’m not feeling well.
Finally got a job!!,"After nearly a year without steady income, I’ve got a job!  Looking back, I was manic and making very impulsive decisions.  But after realizing this (and growing up) I have a job that pays decent with regular hours and weekends off. Couldn’t ask for much better.  Just wanted to share since bipolar disorder can rob us of so much."
Intractable fatigue,"I have been suffering fatigue and hypersomnia since mid February.  I'm on meds that I take religiously and do my best to be regular with supplements and eat healthy. I exercise a few days a week.  I've even reintroduced coffee into my daily routine. But it's not seemed to have much of an effect.  Im sleeping 10 hours a night and struggling to wake up and wake up fatigued.  It's tough to work a full time job, take care of my 7 yo and be productive.  Especially when you add anxiety, resistance and confusion into the mix which tend to come and go.  I'm relatively new to the diagnosis though I had suspicions.. Trying to figure out if this is it.  Can it get better? Is there something I should do?"
Bipolar and adhd,Recently talking with my doc for our monthly appointment and he pointed out that even though my medication is helping I am showing some of the markers of adhd as well. Anyone here have both? Specifically BPII?
Auditory Hallucinations,"I wanted to know if you have these, Are they outside your head or inside? If that makes sense. I always have people just having random conversations but it's inside my head and I don't really know what they're talking about, just once I notice someone's talking and pay attention, it mostly stops. And I'm like who the heck are you and what were you talking about? Lol"
My wife says this sub is too dangerous for me to be on.,She believes all the pain and agony will trigger me into a depression. She has nursed me through enough of those and doesn't want to do it again.
Works Making me So Anxious/Emotional It's Hard To Function,"anxious and stressed after what happened to me at work. (Had a customer on drugs ask me repeatedly for money to buy cigarettes, to which I told him repeatedly I had non.   He then got in my face, very forcefully poked the lens on my glasses and told me ""you better rethink that answer""  I'm now having stressful awful dreams at night, can't sleep well."
How do you handle such stressful situations?,"I’m so stressed and im scared its going to propel me into a manic episode. My last manic episode put me in over 10k debt that I still have to pay off somehow. I lost my job due to my son being sick ( much better now ) and rent is due, phone bill is due , I have no groceries ( except his food , I go without ) and im so stressed . I’ve been applying to jobs like crazy and no one will take me during my sons school hours. I am so so soo stressed and my anxiety is in overdrive I feel like im going to explode. I cant ask for help because I cannot pay anyone back right now. im so tired it shouldn’t be this hard. I feel so overwhelmed im on the verge of breaking something or completely shutting down, but im doing my best to keep a level head. I’ve tried going to family , music , adult coloring and nothing is helping ."
Interesting appointment,"You'd think this would be about my psychiatrist or therapist. NOPE. It was an OBGYN appointment. I was scheduled to meet with a NP about a lump in my breast. We were going through my list of medications and asked what these are being used to treat. I disclosed that I am diagnosed bipolar 2. She IMMEDIATELY says ""are you really bipolar though? I feel like they diagnose everyone bipolar now and days. Just like they did with autism and ADHD"" my jaw was on the floor. She continued on with, ""everyone deals with mania"". MA'AM. No they don't. Immediately started sweating from rage, in disbelief that someone in her profession would spew absolute bullshit like that. If it wasn't something urgent I was being seen for, I would have left. I knew from self examination that the mass was abnormal, just needed a referral. Left with that, and apparently I'm no longer bipolar so that's cool. Still in disbelief lolol"
Is there a way to cope with executive dysfunction on my own?,I'm still waiting to get a neuropsychiatric assessment done.
How to get through a hypomanic episode without meds?,I'm already on meds but I'm just wondering what I should do when I get those breakthrough mild hypomanic episodes. Something that isn't adding or raising meds because I'm sensitive to med side effects. How should I get through a breakthrough hypomanic episode without it spiraling into something dangerous?
I'm in the hospital,
"my bipolar is going to ruin everything again, and i’m terrified",i never post of reddit as i prefer to just lurk and read posts but so much has been going on i finally decided to take the leap and make a post. (i am also on my phone so apologies for any issues)
I finally feel happy,I’ve been describing the past week as “the third worst week of my life.” I started feeling low and put myself into a really unsafe situation more than once.
Seroquel reducing paranoia?,"I made a post on here a couple days back about how seroquel has allowed me to sleep without fear. Last night I decided to not take it as I have a lot to do today and didn’t want to sleep through the day or be drowsy. I thought I’d be able to fall asleep  eventually but I wasn’t able too, I was just so paranoid and skittish over every noise and movement. I had assumed that the seroquel was just making me sleep fast and that’s what helped with my sleeping habits but I’ve noticed that throughout the day I wasn’t quite as paranoid. Is it possible the seroquel has tuned down my paranoia and this early on it?"
Lithium and staying hydrated,"How do you all stay hydrated while on lithium? I started taking lithium almost two weeks ago and my skin, lips and mouth feel super dry (kinda like it would be winter time). I try to drink around 2 litres of water every day but it might not be enough. Any tips on electrolytes? And maybe great moisturisers and lip balms as well? Anything else to consider?"
He likes me better when I'm manic,"A few weeks ago, I asked my husband when was the last time he looked at me and thought, ""Wow, I really love that woman!"" His answer was during my last hypermanic episode. He then followed up by saying that he actually likes me a lot better whenever I'm ""going through an up episode"" because I ""act happier and do more chores"". I know it's been a while since that exchange happened, but it's been really eating at me the past few days... especially since I've been stable for almost a month now (something I thought would never happen!) Has anyone else had a similar experience with a partner? How did you handle it?"
Must i change my doctor?,"Hi. I went one doctor and psychologist since 8 month. But doctor is not good, psychologist so so. He's looking at the computer instead of looking at me. Psychologist recommend this doctor. I haven't had an attack for 4 years but I suffer from side effects. It's been 8 months and I'm still talking about side effects. These people was not fixed my problem. Must i change my doctor?"
i hate mania more than i hate depression,"my friends don’t understand this at all, and i don’t have any other friends who are bipolar to talk to this about, so excuse the rant."
"Conflicted about ""controlling"" my emotions","I find it really easy to stay silent whenever I'm angry or sad, same with mania, even if I feel extremely energetic and happy I still manage to mask it. This can be good but it just makes me feel like shit, it's so hard to ever let my emotions out and tell someone how I'm really feeling."
"When people think mental illness is ""mind over matter""","I'm new this sub. I have recently been diagnosed. Really now a lot of things make sense. I've been very open about it to the few people I trust. However, I keep getting a lot of comments that just make me so angry. An example below."
What are ways I can walk myself back from an oncoming breakdown?,"Currently at work, and I can feel it building. I'm probably a 7 from a scale of 1-10. I never know how to avoid these breakdowns. I cannot afford to leave work, if I do it will put my job at risk."
How were you diagnosed?,What happened in your life or what were you experiencing when you were diagnosed?
Overwhelmed and feeling IN LOVE after a doctor’s appointment. LOL,
Bipolar creature #2,
My manic episode of 6 months has finally come to an end,"So, I’ve been struggling super bad flipping from mania to hypomania temporarily with adjustments in medications. Usually I know manic episodes are done because I’m able to reflect on how embarrassing and insane it was when it’s over. I did that today while feeing ok (but not on top of the world). I haven’t done that since the beginning of December of 2022."
How do y’all not focus on the potential side effects of medication?,"I started lamictal like 2 months. Today I haven’t really been hungry. Stupid ass me looks up “lamictal causeing decreased appetite” and liver issues pop up under potential warning of lamictal bro. Now I’m fucking paranoid that I’m ruining my liver…. I don’t want to take the meds anymore, the past 2 months has just been me obsessing over potential side effects of the meds and I’m tired of it."
Sober 7 months,Currently 7 months sober from all drugs and alcohol.  Long struggle of substance abuse trying to minimize BP symptoms.   Don’t feel perfect by any stretch but feel ok and sometimes good.
Why do people say feelings are controllable?,"I work for a big company and we have these monthly meetings geared towards women in the workplace. Today’s meeting was on mental health. While there were some valuable things and observations discussed; I found myself hot under the collar about one particular comment everyone seemed to be making. “You can be mindful and understand that you can control what you’re feeling.” No one at work knows I am Bipolar for obvious reasons. This pissed me off so much though that I had to bite my tongue not to lash out. As everyone here knows, some of us do not have the luxury of having command over our emotions. I wish my brain didn’t betray me every single day because of a disorder I didn’t sign up for! I get so angry at neurotypical people sometimes because they don’t understand, they will never understand and we’re still faced with a seemingly everlasting stigma around having Bipolar. Their scope is so limited and if they really gave a damn about mental health then mental illness would be included in discussions even if it can only be discussed briefly because of HR regulations. If you read this thank you. I really needed to get that off my chest because I can’t talk to anyone right now about it. It’s just so incredibly frustrating."
Covid made me Agoraphobic,"Basically, my immune system sucks. Which in turn made me extremely afraid of Covid. I was an essential employee working at a restaurant during the first half of it and the lack of consideration was making me lose my mind. After a few months I left and made sure to continue taking the proper precautions based on my bodies ability to fight off illnesses but somewhere along the way I feel like I became paranoid. I was eventually diagnosed as Agoraphobic on top of everything. I now take two different anxiety meds four times a day in an attempt to keep my panic attacks and random crying spells under control. I haven’t left my house other than to see my fiancé’s family one time in the last three months. My fiancé and I are home bodies anyway but I know the extent of what’s happening isn’t okay coupled with how long it’s been going on. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? I desperately need help. My poor therapist and psychiatrist have no idea how to help me anymore than they have. Anyone that even just has any ideas would be greatly appreciated."
I feel like I’m losing hope,I am usually a pretty optimistic person and I have my moments of despair but I manage to have a positive outlook on life even in my most harrowing moments.
Lamotrigine saved my life,
Safety of taking Vyvanse while being bipolar? Is anyone else here on this med?,"My NP prescribed me vyvanse for neurodivergence related problems, but I  have worries about it. I haven't had hypo-/manic symptoms in several  months, and we tried atomoxetine earlier this year and there was still  no hypomanic with it either (which I stopped because it made me too  sick). But after the first dose of vyvanse, this feels a little more  ""oomph"" than I've been used to and I worry about it. My biggest question  is, if I have no induced hypomanic problems early on does it mean it  shouldn't do that later on? Or am I at risk forever? Any other things I  should know? Is anyone here on this med?"
